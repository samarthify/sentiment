# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Comparison Report Feature

The dashboard now includes a Comparison Report feature that allows users to analyze differences between two CSV datasets:

### Features

- **Dataset Overview**: Compare the number of entries and overall statistics between two datasets
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Compare average sentiment scores and distribution of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments
- **Platform Analysis**: Visualize changes in platform distribution with charts and detailed tables
- **Country Analysis**: Track changes in geographical distribution of mentions
- **New Entries Analysis**: View entries that appear in the new dataset but not in the old one

### How to Use

1. Navigate to the "Comparison Report" page using the sidebar menu
2. By default, the system compares `processed_data_old.csv` and `processed_data.csv`
3. You can change the filenames in the input fields if needed
4. Click "Compare Files" to generate a new comparison report
5. Use the Export PDF button to save the report

### Technical Details

The comparison functionality uses the following files:
- `ComparisonService.js`: Handles loading and analyzing CSV files
- `ComparisonReport.js`: React component for displaying the comparison results

CSV files are automatically copied from `data/processed/` to the `public` directory when running the dashboard.
