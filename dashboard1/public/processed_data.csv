But not only Qatar: in the last photo, Ahmed al-Sharaa is meeting the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Jordan. The cozy kingdom is also in a hurry to normalize relations with the new Syria. Let me remind you that both Qatar and Jordan are official US allies outside of NATO, and it is already known that the issue of joint cooperation against terrorism was among the topics discussed.

Terrorism in the region is ISIS and Iranian proxies, or those whom Washington points a finger at. The same Ahmed al-Sharaa has already been charged the price of 10 million dead presidents. Today you are a terrorist, and tomorrow, if the white gentlemen want, you are no longer a terrorist.

Open Letter to His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani: Embracing Women’s Leadership in Constitutional Reform

Your Highness,
@TamimBinHamad
I would like to begin by offering my deepest congratulations on your visionary approach to equal citizenship and your commitment to national unity through recent constitutional reforms. It is clear that Qatar’s progress is not just a product of your leadership but a legacy built on the remarkable foundation laid by your mother, Her Highness Sheikha Moza bint Nasser. Her relentless tenacity, boundless creativity, and unwavering bravery have not only shaped the future of Qatar but also positioned it as a leader in education, healthcare, and human development across the region.

@mozabintnasser
Sheikha Moza’s groundbreaking contributions—from spearheading the Qatar Foundation to her pivotal role in elevating Qatar’s global educational standards—have been instrumental in transforming the nation. Her leadership has not only enhanced Qatar's reputation internationally but also ensured that future generations, particularly women, can step forward as the next leaders of this country.

Your Highness, it is because of this legacy that I propose an essential shift in the Constitution to ensure that if the brightest, most capable individual is a woman, including one of your own daughters, she should have every right to inherit the highest office in the land. There is no greater reform than this—one that recognizes the critical role women play in shaping the future and positions Qatar as a true pioneer in the Arabian Peninsula.

By institutionalizing the leadership potential of women through constitutional amendments, you would not only honor the legacy of your mother, but you would also create a transformative moment in history where Qatar becomes the first to offer such progressive leadership in the region. A future where your daughters or any brilliant Qatari woman can hold the same position you do is a future of true equality, progress, and unmatched success for Qatar.

The world will remember this reform as the boldest step forward—a testament to your foresight and dedication to creating a Qatar that remains ahead of the curve, ready to embrace a new era of leadership.

I look forward to seeing this monumental shift in Qatar’s constitutional future, and I am confident that you will continue to lead the way with courage, just as your mother did.

With the highest respect and regard,

Open Letter to His Highness Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, Emir of Qatar
Assalamu'alaikum warahmatullahi wbarakatu .
May the peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be with you all my dear Blessed brother in Islam 
@TamimBinHamad
We are deeply grateful for your unwavering stance in support of our brothers and sisters in Lebanon and Gaza, as well as for your prompt action to provide humanitarian assistance to all those affected by these brutal aggressions. Your words and actions remind us of our collective responsibility: that each of us is accountable for what we are capable of doing to the best of our ability. We appreciate your commitment to doing whatever you can, and we stand in admiration of your leadership in these challenging times.

As Muslims, we are reminded of the importance of unity and solidarity. We pray to Allah, as the Quran tells us:

> ""وَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِهِمْ ۚ لَوْ أَنفَقْتَ مَا فِي الْأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا مَّا أَلَّفْتَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِهِمْ وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ أَلَّفَ بَيْنَهُمْ ۚ إِنَّهُ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ""
""And He brought together their hearts. If you had spent all that is in the earth, you could not have brought their hearts together; but Allah brought them together. Indeed, He is Exalted in Might and Wise."" (Surah Al-Anfal 8:63)

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was continuously reminded that only Allah can unite hearts. No matter how much wealth or effort was expended, it would never be enough to bring people together if Allah did not will it. Therefore, we pray to Allah that our hearts are united so that our collective efforts can make a difference in saving the Palestinian people and protecting the people of Gaza and Lebanon from these brutal aggressions.

Indeed, the criminals have transgressed beyond all limits, and they have not even been criticized by the international community, let alone stopped. As Muslims, it is our duty to put our trust in Allah and work towards a future where we are never put in such a vulnerable position again. We must strive to build the best defense mechanism that can protect Muslims around the globe, and we have the capabilities to establish a military-industrial complex that will be unrivaled anywhere in the world.

We pray that this is the last time we witness the massacre of our people without having the means to defend them. We must be the ones whom Allah has entrusted with the peace and prosperity of the planet—from combating climate change to ensuring justice for all. Allah says:

> ""إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالإِحْسَانِ""
""Indeed, Allah commands justice and good conduct."" (Surah An-Nahl 16:90)

We are the real leaders, and it is upon us to uphold justice for ourselves and for all of humanity.

May Allah bless you and the people of Qatar for your courage and your contributions. May He protect all Muslims from oppression and suffering. We pray that Allah grants us the strength, wisdom, and unity to stand as one Ummah, to defend the oppressed, and to uphold justice and righteousness. May He make us among those who are entrusted with the responsibility of bringing peace and prosperity to the world.

آمين يا رب العالمين
Ameen, ya Rabb al-'Alamin.

Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi issued a stern warning during a phone call with Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim ibn Hamad Al Thani, emphasizing that any action against Iran's interests will be met with a severe response. 

Raisi highlighted the ongoing plight of Palestinians in Gaza and urged effective measures to halt Israel's atrocities. He condemned the terrorist attack on Iran's consulate in Damascus and criticized the UN Security Council for its failure to condemn the attack. 

Emir Hamad Al Thani reaffirmed the strong bond between Iran and Qatar and commended Qatar's efforts to denounce Israel's aggression. He praised Iran's strategic response to Israel's crimes. Meanwhile, Israel's war cabinet is set to meet to deliberate on its reaction to Iran's drone and missile assault.

Qatar’s Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani has brought together the leaders of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda in a “fruitful meeting” in an attempt to calm the situation in eastern DRC.

In a statement on Tuesday, the Amiri Diwan said Sheikh Tamim sat down with DRC’s President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame at the Lusail Palace in Doha.

“The Heads of State then agreed on the need to continue the discussions initiated in Doha in order to establish solid foundations for lasting peace as envisioned in the Luanda/Nairobi process,” the three countries said in a joint statement. 

Both leaders also thanked Qatar’s Amir for organising the “fruitful meeting, which helped build confidence in a shared commitment to a secure and stable future” for DRC and the region.

The discussions in Doha marked the first face-to-face meeting between the two presidents since rebels from the March 23rd Movement (M23) launched an offensive in eastern DRC where they captured the major cities of Goma and Bukavu.

DRC says more than 7,000 people have been killed in the territory since the beginning of the year.

The United States, the United Nations and DRC have long accused the M23 of being backed by Rwanda—claims that Kigali repeatedly denied.

Planned talks in Angola, which mediated the Luanda Roadmap in 2022, were cancelled on Tuesday after M23 representatives pulled out of the meeting. The last time the Congolese government and the M23 held talks was in 2013, according to AFP.

In January 2023, Qatar attempted to host peace talks between DRC and Rwanda to return them to the Luanda agreement as tensions soared.

The Qatari mediation efforts appeared to gain momentum last month, when Qatar’s Minister of State at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mohammed Al-Khulaifi, held separate meetings with DRC and Rwanda’s leaders in both countries. 

The meetings at the time focused on tensions in the Great Lakes region.

“Qatar reaffirms once again that dialogue is the optimal means for resolving disputes between countries[…]hoping that direct dialogue and constructive discussions will continue to achieve a bright future for the region,” Al-Khulaifi said in a post on X on Tuesday.",,https://dohanews.co/qatars-amir-brings-together-drc-and-rwandas-leaders-following-heightened-tensions/,,,qatar,,news,,,,,,2,6,,11,,,dohanews.co,,,,,,,,positive,0.9973065853118896

The two foreign ministers also addressed the situation in Afghanistan, underlining the importance of high-level meetings between the leaders of Qatar and Turkmenistan to enhance bilateral relations.

During the meeting in Doha, Sheikh Mohammed and Meredov also discussed updates on the construction of the Serhetabat-Herat section of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline.

News,qa,post,298814908,2025-03-10,"Gaza’s last Nepali captive Nepal’s Bipin Joshi was 23 when he was taken captive by Hamas during the October 7, 2023 Operation Al Aqsa flood.

As the first phase of Hamas-Israel ceasefire ended, a quiet yet powerful hope pulses through Nepal. With every passing moment, the nation holds its breath, praying for the return of one of its own—Bipin Joshi. 

“For these 17 months, we’ve neither had hunger nor been able to sleep,” Bipin’s father, Mahananda Joshi, said in a video interview last month.

“We have spent all these days and nights just looking for our son.” 

The Gaza ceasefire, brokered by Qatar, the U.S., and Egypt in January, between Hamas and Israel, led to the release of 33 Israeli captives and five Thai workers.

The first phase of the truce wrapped up on March 1, with Hamas handing over the bodies of four captives in the last exchange with Israel.

While Israel’s streets echo with the “Bring Them Home” campaign, Nepal has quietly continued its efforts to secure the release of Bipin Joshi, taken from the Alumim Kibbutz (settlemtent) on October 7, 2023.

At 23, Bipin Joshi left Nepal in September 2023 to take part in Israel’s “learn and earn” program, an opportunity for agriculture students. It was supposed to be an 11-month internship on an Israeli farm.

This program, a part of the 65-year diplomatic ties between Israel and Nepal, was designed for students like Joshi with hands-on agricultural skills. 

“While leaving for Israel, he had promised to return to fulfill his dream of creating opportunities in agriculture for others, once he was done with his studies,” Joshi’s mother, Padma, told broadcaster Prime Times HD in April 2024. 

During their time in Israel, Nepali students like Joshi balanced studies with practical work at the Sedot Negev Agricultural Training Center. 

Joshi, a student of Far-Western University’s School of Agriculture, was among 49 students in the 2023 batch of the program, where the students had to pay just the airfare, and lived and worked on the farm five days a week.

Joshi’s cohort was the first one to set off for Israel from their campus, according to Rohit Nayak, Joshi’s colleague and program batch-mate. 

The students, Joshi included, were told “rockets would sometimes be fired to Gaza” before departing for the program and were not made aware of the broader geopolitical context and history, Nayak told Doha News.

Joshi was stationed at Alumim, a small distance from the Gaza Strip, when the October 7 attack took place in Re’im.

In the chaos, 10 Nepali students lost their lives and six more were injured. Joshi was taken captive after a bomb was thrown into the bunker where he and other foreign nationals, including Thai workers, had taken shelter, Nayak added.

“He and I were stationed in different groups [when the attack took place],” said Nayak, who was evacuated from Israel on October 13. “He was taken at around 10pm to 12am on October 7, according to those who were there.”

CCTV footage from the Sedot Negev Agricultural Training Center showed Joshi’s last known moments at the Shifa Hospital in Gaza on October 7, 2023.

As days stretch into months, Joshi’s family, alongside Nepali officials and citizens, continue to hold onto the hope that the now 24-year-old is still alive. His mother’s last phone call with him was on October 6, just one day before his capture—a fleeting moment of connection that now feels like an eternity.

Qatar, Joshi, and Gaza mediation 

Qatar has played a significant role as a mediator in efforts to broker a deal between Hamas and Israel, especially after the onset of Israel’s military operations in Gaza in October 2023. The conflict has led to the loss of over 61,709 Palestinian lives in the past 16 months.

On January 19, after a year of stalled negotiations, Qatar announced the beginning of a truce, which involved a three-phase ceasefire and a captives-prisoner agreement.

The first phase of the truce includes the release of 33 captives by Hamas in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian detainees. Each phase is set to last 42 days.

When Qatar’s Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani visited Nepal in April 2024, becoming the first Arab leader to do so, President Ramchandra Paudel requested for Sheikh Tamim’s support and intervention in securing Joshi’s safe release.

Prior to the trip, Nepal’s ambassador to Qatar Naresh Bikram Dhakal also expressed high hopes of the impact of the Amir’s visit on Joshi’s freedom, appealing to the Amir himself during a call. 

“We had previously submitted a written request for the release of Bipin, emphasising his distinct identity, through the Foreign Ministry,” Dhakal told the Rising Nepal Daily.

Joshi’s family had delivered a letter to Nepal’s president and then-prime minister to raise the agenda with Qatar’s leader, which Nepali officials honoured. 

In response, Sheikh Tamim assured that he would do his best to secure the student’s return to Nepal, according to foreign relations adviser to the president, Suresh Chalise.

“Joshi’s safe release is one of our prime concerns, and the President asked for the Amir’s support in securing it,” press adviser to Nepal’s president, Kiran Pokhrel, told the Kathmandu Post.

On February 16, Nepali Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba met with Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sultan bin Saad bin Sultan Al Muraikhi in Oman, renewing requests for Qatar’s assistance in securing the return of Bipin Joshi to Nepal.

“We discussed efforts to secure the release of Mr. Bipin Joshi, who has been held captive by Hamas since October 7, 2023. We hope Mr. Joshi will be released soon,” the foreign minister said in a post on X. 

Earlier that day, Deuba held a phone call with Qatar’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi to make the same appeal, urging Qatar to take special initiatives.

Joshi’s family has remained in touch with the Israeli embassy in Nepal with reassurances of safe release. However, the reassurances and actions from Nepal’s government have not been enough, according to the family. 

Pressure has been mounting on the Nepali government to take swift action and ensure the safe return of the student.

“We still have the same fear in our hearts—what if war happens again?” Joshi’s mother Padma said in an interview days after the Hamas-Israel ceasefire agreement was announced in January. 

“The government must take the initiative to ensure that my innocent son returns safely to Nepal,” she added. 

According to Board of Deputies of British Jews, Joshi is set to be released in phase two of the Gaza ceasefire.

59 captives remaining in Gaza, 24 of whom Israel believes are alive.

The second phase entails that all captives be released by Hamas, and that Israel fully withdraws from the besieged territory. 

Back at Joshi’s village home, near the Indian border, around 700 kilometers west of Kathmandu, his family leaves his slippers by the door, holding onto the hope that one day, he will walk through it again.",,https://dohanews.co/gazas-last-nepali-captive/,,,qatar,,news,,,,,,4,7,,2,,,dohanews.co,,,,,,,,positive,0.9981662631034851
News,qa,post,297160030,2025-03-05,"Qatar’s Amir reiterates support for Palestinians at Arab Summit Arab leaders adopted Egypt’s $53bn plan for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip and rejected the forced displacement plan of Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan.

Qatar’s Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani attended the emergency Arab Summit on Palestine in Cairo on Tuesday, where he reaffirmed his support for the rights of Palestinians.

“We look forward to uniting efforts, intensifying action and coordinating collectively with all our brothers to support the Palestinian people in achieving their full legitimate rights in accordance with international legitimacy resolutions,” Sheikh Tamim said in a post on X.

“Establishing an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital is the foundation of stability and peace in the Middle East,” he added.

At the summit, Arab leaders adopted Egypt’s $53bn (about QAR 193bn) plan for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip and rejected the forced displacement plan of Palestinians to Egypt and Jordan, as put forth by U.S President Donald Trump last month.

The framework would take place over three phases, which would take up to five years to implement. 

“Egypt is developing a comprehensive and integrated plan for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, without the displacement of the Palestinians. This shall begin with urgent relief operations and early recovery, leading to the reconstruction of the strip,” Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi told the summit.

The summit’s final communique expressed the Arab leaders’ complete rejection of “any form of displacement of the Palestinian people” while warning that such attempts “would lead the region into a new phase of conflicts”.

The statement stressed that Israel, as the occupying power, must “comply with relevant international legitimacy resolutions, which reject any attempts to alter the demographic composition of Palestinian territory”.

Hamas welcomed the Arab leaders’ rejection of the forced displacement of Palestinians and Israel’s settlement expansions.

“We value the words of leaders at the extraordinary Arab summit in Cairo, all of which affirmed the rejection of the occupation’s plans to displace our people, the rejection of annexation and settlement projects, and the support of human rights,” Hamas said on its Telegram channel on Tuesday.

Condemnation of blocking aid

Israel’s 15-month genocide has caused a dire humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip, and killed more than 61,709 Palestinians, with thousands still trapped under the rubble.

Qatar, Egypt and the United States mediated a fragile ceasefire that came into effect on January 19 that is split into three phases, each lasting 42 days. 

The first phase ended on Saturday, March 1. The following day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to halt the entry of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip in a clear violation of the ceasefire deal that stipulated the unhindered entry of relief aid.

The decision came as two million Muslims in the Gaza Strip observe the fasting month of Ramadan in the middle of complete destruction and significant shortage of basic resources.

The Arab leaders at Cairo’s summit reiterated their condemnation of Israel’s decision, calling out the occupation’s weaponisation of starvation. 

Israel has repeatedly stalled all efforts aimed at reaching a complete ceasefire by insisting on continuing its war while refusing to completely withdraw its forces from the blockaded territory.",,https://dohanews.co/qatars-amir-reiterates-support-for-palestinians-at-arab-summit/,,,qatar,,news,,,,,,7,4,,3,,,dohanews.co,,,,,,,,positive,0.9983999133110046
News,qa,post,296177418,2025-03-02,"AI, Energy, and Sustainability: Insights from Iberdrola’s Santiago Bañales Every breakthrough in sustainability begins with a simple question: “What could we do better?”

We sat down with Santiago Bañales, Managing Director of Iberdrola Innovation Middle East, fresh from his participation in the Corporate Innovation Summit on the opening day of Web Summit Qatar 2025, to discuss the future of energy and sustainability innovation. 

Leading one of the region’s most pioneering centres for AI-based sustainable energy solutions, Bañales drives RDI efforts at the Doha-based centre, focusing on smart networks, storage and renewable energy integration, and digital customer solutions. 

As part of Iberdrola – a global energy company recognised as a leader in renewable energy and networks, and one of the world’s largest electricity companies by market capitalisation – these innovations are shaping the energy landscape across the Middle East, Europe, the Americas, and Asia-Pacific.

What are the biggest ways AI is reshaping the energy sector, and how is Iberdrola Innovation Middle East leading this shift? 

Santiago Bañales [SB]: At Iberdrola Innovation Middle East, we focus on designing, developing, and deploying solutions that help make the world’s energy cleaner and more sustainable by working at the intersection of two key trends: the current AI revolution and the energy transition.

The impact of AI in the energy sector is twofold. First, the new generation of AI, Generative AI, requires a significantly larger amount of energy to train models, making it one of the key drivers of increasing energy demand going forward. 

Second, AI-based products are a key enabler of the energy transition. Energy companies use data and advanced models to radically improve how energy assets—such as solar plants, wind turbines, and networks—are planned, operated, and maintained. AI solutions are also instrumental in continuously maintaining the balance between generation and demand, as well as empowering customers to play an active role in managing the energy system by providing flexibility. This is the focus of our work at Iberdrola Innovation Middle East.

A key aspect of our success is the unique blend of highly specialised talent. Our cross-disciplinary team of product designers, electrical power engineers, digital platform architects, software developers, and data scientists works shoulder to shoulder to develop out-of-the-box solutions, making a significant contribution to the global challenge of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

What are the major milestones that have shaped Iberdrola’s partnership with Qatar—from energy collaboration to innovation leadership?

SB: The relationship between Qatar and Iberdrola has deep roots. Our relationship started several decades ago with the sourcing of natural gas for our combined cycle power plants, reaching an early milestone with the design and construction of the Mesaieed power plant by our Engineering branch.In March 2018, Iberdrola was officially inaugurated in the presence of our Chairman, Ignacio Galán, and Qatar Investment Authority leadership, marking our commitment to cutting-edge innovation in the region.

The latest milestone in this journey came in May 2022, when Iberdrola partnered with Invest Qatar during His Highness the Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani’s state visit to Madrid. This agreement reinforced our focus on digital innovation and sustainability and positioning Qatar as a global player in these areas.

What are Iberdrola Innovation Middle East’s key priorities for 2025 in advancing innovation and sustainability?

SB: In 2025, our value proposition for energy companies is built on three key areas: radically enhancing the productivity of energy assets, developing new solutions that provide flexibility to the energy system, and designing the next generation of AI-based network planning tools.A major priority this year is also leveraging AI to optimize the use of scarce resources, with particular emphasis on the energy-water-food nexus. These themes – centred on digital innovation for sustainability – have been at the forefront of my discussions with leading individuals, companies, startups, and institutions during the Corporate Innovation Summit, the Spanish Embassy-sponsored business meeting with startups, and Web Summit Qatar 2025.It has been an intense week of exchanges and discussions that we hope will positively impact and shape the future of digital innovation and sustainability in Qatar, the Middle East, and beyond.

In what ways has your company impacted the local community in Qatar while focusing on innovation and sustainability?

SB: We believe meaningful change starts at home. Last year, our commitment to the energy transition and global sustainability goals extended to our community in several ways. We aspire for our most significant and lasting contribution to be our dedication to developing young talent and supporting the next generation of digital innovation leaders. 

Every year, we hire young engineers—with most of our team recruited locally—offering our employees a fulfilling career at the intersection of digitalisation and sustainability. We have also provided industrial insights and support to students from local technical universities by hosting summer internships and sponsoring Master’s and PhD programmes in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. This commitment has allowed us to build a strong network of Qatari and global partners, leading to impactful R&D collaborations with universities in Qatar, Spain, and the UK, and a solid track record of high-quality, industry-sponsored scientific research.

Beyond our work with the education sector, we contribute to the community through volunteer work, sports programmes, and diversity and inclusion initiatives. For instance, on World Cleanup Day, we removed 100 kilograms of waste from local beaches with DEAP Qatar, demonstrating that sustainability starts with tangible, local actions that inspire broader environmental responsibility. We also promoted health, teamwork, and community spirit through our company football team, reinforcing the power of unity.

As strategic partners of the Doha Women Forum 2024, we hosted STEMinism: Celebrating Women in STEM, a panel highlighting the importance of diversity in driving innovation.These efforts are more than just initiatives – they reflect our belief that sustainability is about technology, collaboration, and creating a future where everyone has a seat at the table.",,https://dohanews.co/ai-energy-and-sustainability-insights-from-iberdrolas-santiago-banales/,,,qatar,,news,,,,,,2,6,,12,,,dohanews.co,,,,,,,,positive,0.9931280612945557

The region also has several gold mines.The M23 fighters ""are in the neighbourhoods of Walikale"", Fiston Misona, a civil society representative from the community, said early Thursday.Another resident, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they saw groups of armed fighters ""through the windows"" of their house. A Doctors Without Borders (MSF) base was ""caught in the crossfire"" during the fighting but no injuries were reported, local MSF official Marco Doneda said.""The MSF team is concerned about the influx of those wounded in the coming days and hours,"" he said. The M23 has waged a lightning push over the last few months in the mineral-rich eastern DRC, driving the Congolese army out of much of North and South Kivu provinces and raising fears of a wider regional war.Walikale lies at the junction of two roads coming from the cities of Goma and Bukavu, the provincial capitals of North and South Kivu, both now under the M23's control.The DRC government has accused Rwanda of backing the M23 in order to seize valuable mineral resources and rich farmland.Rwanda denies providing the M23 with military support, but a UN experts' report has said that Rwanda maintains around 4,000 troops in the DRC's east to assist the armed group.On Tuesday, Kagame and Tshisekedi met in Doha for talks mediated by Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani.The two African heads of state -- whose previous attempts at talks collapsed at the last minute -- expressed their support for ""an immediate and unconditional ceasefire"", a statement from the three countries said.No details have emerged on the terms of how a ceasefire will be implemented, as it would also have to involve the M23 on the ground to succeed.By coming to the table in Doha ""Kagame is implicitly recognising his role in the rebellion in the east,"" Thierry Vircoulon, associate researcher at the Sub-Saharan Africa Centre of the French Institute for International Relations, told AFP.The M23, however, ""has no negotiating agenda"", he said. ""They have no demands. Their goal is to oust Tshisekedi from power.""The meeting between the two heads of state came after peace talks between Kinshasa and the M23, due to have been held in the Angolan capital Luanda on Tuesday, were cancelled.Half a dozen ceasefires and truces have been brokered, and then broken since the end of 2021.",,https://www.ibtimes.com/m23-fighters-seize-key-dr-congo-town-despite-ceasefire-bid-3767101,,,us,,news,,,,,,4,4,,8,,,ibtimes.com,,,,,,,,positive,0.9780229926109314

News,us,post,301751908,2025-03-19,"Presidents of Congo and Rwanda meet in Qatar to discuss the insurgency in eastern Congo DAKAR, Senegal -- The presidents of Congo and neighboring Rwanda met Tuesday in Qatar for their first direct talks since Rwanda-backed M23 rebels seized two major cities in mineral-rich eastern Congo earlier this year.

The meeting between Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwanda’s President Paul Kagame to discuss the insurgency was mediated by Qatar, the three governments said in a statement. The state-run Qatar News Agency published an image of the two African leaders meeting with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the energy-rich nation's ruling emir. 

Congo and Rwanda reaffirmed their commitment to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, but the joint statement offered no specifics on how that ceasefire would be implemented or monitored.

The summit came as a previous attempt to bring Congo’s government and M23 leaders together for ceasefire negotiations failed. The rebels pulled out Monday after the European Union announced sanctions on rebel leaders. 

Qatar has hosted peace talks between Afghanistan's Taliban and the United States, Chad and rebel forces and over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. 

A diplomat briefed on the meeting said both Tshisekedi and Kagame had formally requested Qatar’s mediation for the talks, which the diplomat said were informal and aimed at building trust rather than resolving all outstanding issues. The diplomat spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.

Peace talks between Congo and Rwanda were unexpectedly canceled in December after Rwanda made the signing of a peace agreement conditional on a direct dialogue between Congo and the M23 rebels, which Congo refused at the time.

The conflict in eastern Congo escalated in January when the Rwanda-backed rebels advanced and seized the strategic city of Goma, followed by Bukavu in February.

M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda, in a conflict that has created one of the world’s most significant humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced.

The rebels are supported by about 4,000 troops from neighboring Rwanda, according to U.N. experts, and at times have vowed to march as far as Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) to the east.

She wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office, saying that her husband was ""under immense mental pressure/trauma"".

""Our frequent appeals to the concerned authorities in Doha have not yet yielded any positive response,"" she wrote.

The letter was acknowledged on 18 February and referred to India's foreign ministry but nothing has happened since then, Ms Goyal told the BBC.

""We have sought a meeting with Prime Minister Modi and Foreign Minister S Jaishankar. Until they intervene, we don't expect anything will happen,"" she said.

In February, Amit Gupta's parents travelled to Doha and managed to meet him with the help of Indian embassy there.

""When we saw him, he just hugged us and cried. He kept repeating that he had done nothing wrong,"" his father said, adding that his son hasn't been questioned by investigators in Qatar yet.

""If they have not found anything against him, he should be released,"" he said.

Hundreds of thousands of Indians live and work in Qatar. This is the second high-profile case of Indians being detained or arrested in Qatar to make headlines since 2022. 

Last year, a court in the Gulf country released eight former Indian naval officers who had been sentenced to death. Neither Qatar nor India revealed the charges against the men, who were working for a private firm in Qatar. But media reports said the men were charged with spying for Israel.

The commuting of the death sentences was seen as a diplomatic triumph for Modi, whose administration shares a warm relationship with Qatar. In February, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the Emir of Qatar, paid a state visit to India, accompanied by a high-level delegation. During the visit, the two countries elevated their relationship to a strategic partnership.

While Amit Gupta's anxious family wait anxiously, Ms Goyal says she is finding it hard to answer questions from their children, aged 11 and four.

A statement by the Qatari royal court said Sheikh Tamim received a call from Putin during which they “discussed bilateral relations and ways to further enhance them.”

The leaders also “dealt with key regional and international developments of joint interest.”

The statement did not provide further details, but the call comes two days after another call between US President Donald Trump and Putin, during which details related to a ceasefire proposal between Russia and Ukraine were discussed.

On Feb. 24, 2022, Russia launched a military offensive against Ukraine. Moscow demands Kyiv abandon aspirations to join Western military alliances as a condition for peace, a stance Ukraine views as “interference” in its sovereignty.

News,gb,post,302719092,2025-03-21,"How Victoria Beckham's £70 million brand spiced up the fashion industry  There was a time when the style set scorned the idea of a Spice Girl becoming a serious designer, but 'Posh' Victoria Beckham has never been one to follow the script. 

For more than a decade, the wife of David Beckham has transformed her eponymous label from a celebrity-backed passion project into a powerhouse in the luxury fashion industry - though not without its fair share of challenges along the way. 

Today, Victoria Beckham is a name whispered with reverence in the front rows of Paris Fashion Week, proving that persistence, reinvention, and an impeccable eye for design can rewrite even the most sceptical narratives. 

As of March 2025, VB's net worth is estimated to be around £70 million, largely thanks to her eponymous fashion label. Her designs have graced the steps of the Met Gala, been worn by some of Hollywood's most influential actresses, and in 2017, won her an OBE for contributions to the fashion industry as presented by Prince William. 

HELLO! revisits the pop princess-turned-fashion mogul's enduring journey from Wannabe fashion designer to Paris Fashion Week mainstay… 

Victoria Beckham's 2008 debut

The year is 2008, seven years after the Spice Girls disbanded, and Victoria Beckham rebrands as a fashion designer with her first collection debuting at New York Fashion Week. 

The highly-anticipated collection featured a tightly curated selection of ten expertly tailored dresses, exuding sophistication and clean lines. Despite initial doubts from industry insiders, the collection was met with widespread praise. 

The designs spoke for themselves, and before long, A-listers like Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, and Kate Winslet were stepping out in Victoria's sleek, form-fitting creations.

Building a Beckham empire

By 2011, Victoria's transition from WAG to fashion designer had been more successful than initially predicted. The mother-of-four wasted no time in growing her brand, expanding her line to include 'Victoria by Victoria Beckham', a ready-to-wear collection at more affordable prices. 

The brand's online presence grew, with the launch of an e-commerce platform in 2013, and by 2019, Victoria Beckham Beauty had made its debut; a natural extension of Victoria's vision to build her fashion and beauty empire. 

Structured dresses? Check. Impeccably tailored suits? Always. Ms Beckham had a knack for blending British elegance with an ultra-cool, modern aesthetic, and the industry couldn’t help but take notice. Fashion critics sang her praises, and soon enough, her brand had secured a fixture at London Fashion Week - officially sealing her status as a designer to watch.

A wave of financial struggles

Behind the glossy runway shows and celebrity endorsements, challenges brewed. Despite strong brand recognition, Victoria's luxury label struggled to turn a profit. Losses mounted year after year - £12.5 million in 2018, ballooning to £16.6 million in 2019. The pandemic only exacerbated these financial woes, with supply chain issues and declining luxury spending cementing the brand’s struggles.

The reinvention of Victoria Beckham Determined to shift the narrative, Beckham and her team embarked on a strategic restructuring. In 2018, fashion industry veteran Ralph Toledano was brought on board as chairman, tasked with steering the brand toward profitability. 

Pricing strategies were refined, operations streamlined, and a renewed focus on bestselling categories - like eyewear and beauty - helped recalibrate the brand’s financial trajectory.

After a tough 2022, Victoria, her husband, the former England footballer David, and NEO injected £6.9m to keep the business going, per The Guardian. Sales surged by 52% to £89.1 million in 2023, cementing the brand’s newfound financial stability and industry prestige.

Today, it's clear to see Victoria Beckham is no longer defined by her pop star past. The business powerhouse has crafted a legacy as a designer who not only understands style, but has also proven her staying power in an industry that often resists celebrity-driven brands.

Her collections continue to grace the runways of Paris, worn by the likes of Angelia Jolie, Salma Hayek, and her close friend Eva Longoria. The aesthetic remains sharp, think clean lines, impeccable tailoring, and an effortless mix of feminine and androgynous elements, epitomising a modern woman’s wardrobe.

In an era where countless celebrity brands come and go, Victoria's label is a rare triumph. And if her recent shoulder-brushing with royalty is anything to go by, her legacy in the fashion world is set to be everlasting. 

Victoria was most recently amongst a flurry of stars invited to Buckingham Palace to mark the 15th anniversary of Women of the World (WOW) hosted by Her Majesty Queen Camilla.

Earlier this year, she and David attended a State Banquet, which honoured the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and his wife Sheikha Jawaher bint Hamad bin Suhaim Al Thani during their state visit to the UK. 

One month later, the Beckhams were invited to Highgrove House, King Charles' beloved private residence in The Cotswolds, for an intimate black-tie dinner celebrating sustainability.",,https://www.hellomagazine.com/fashion/celebrity-style/821378/victoria-beckham-journey-from-spice-girl-to-fashion-designer/,,,uk,,news,,,,,,5,8,,6,,,hellomagazine.com,,,,,,,,positive,0.9991293549537659
News,gb,post,302128696,2025-03-19,"The Olympics' own Conclave begins - as hotly contested race for IOC president reaches climax Electing the new boss of the Olympics first required a grandly titled ""sacred pilgrimage"" to ancient Olympia - to pay homage to the birthplace of what's become a multibillion-pound behemoth. And after the pageantry comes pure politics. The International Olympic Committee's (IOC) own Conclave is taking place today - the most-contested presidential election in its history after a campaign cloaked in secrecy. Those running for the presidency have been impeded by a labyrinth of rules. They can give the impression of limiting opportunities for the most confident of the orators and most experienced sports leader in the contest - Lord Sebastian Coe - from outshining rivals more favoured by the IOC establishment. It has been a contest where his policies have stood out from the field. He is the first advocate of a blanket ban on transgender women competing in women's sports - endorsing US President Donald Trump's stance ahead of LA hosting the 2028 Olympics. And Lord Coe is the only contender defying Thomas Bach's current IOC leadership by calling for Olympic medallists to receive money. But being a disruptor could harm his chances in a contest where open debate has been banned. Even the only formal presentations allowed to voters were held in private in January, with attendees forced to hand in their phones just as they will for today's vote at the luxury Greek resort of Costa Navarino. The election has been forced into the shadows, while the Olympics are trying to maintain relevance with young audiences by having visibility. Lord Coe has already called for a ""more open and expansive process"" in future. The winner will be only the 10th president in the 131-year history of the IOC. Coe's main rivals The main threat to Lord Coe becoming the first Briton to lead the Olympic movement is considered to come from current IOC vice president Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr and double Olympic champion swimmer Kirsty Coventry. Now Zimbabwe's sports minister, she is trying to become the first African and first woman to serve in perhaps the most powerful job in sport. ""Let's create some change, let's make sure that happens,"" said the 41-year-old. Lord Coe, at 68, is the oldest candidate. But not only is he also a double Olympic champion in middle-distance running, he went on to win the bid for London 2012 and oversee the organisation. Then he went tougher than most in sport on Russia over a mass doping scandal after being elected World Athletics President a decade ago. Add into that his political career with the Conservatives at Westminster and running a sports marketing firm. Mr Samaranch, a Spanish financier, can tout his business credentials while clearly being the establishment candidate - with his father previously leading the IOC for 21 years. Both Mr Samaranch and Ms Coventry have indicated there are issues around fairness if the women's sports category is not protected. They have not been clear how that would be achieved given the IOC has been leaving it for individual sports to decide on eligibility. Outsiders There is another British candidate: Johan Eliasch, who also holds Swedish citizenship. Despite leading the international ski federation since 2021, he has only been an IOC member since last year after becoming a billionaire through sportswear firm Head. David Lappartient, the French cycling federation president, has already taken the IOC into a new era by overseeing the launch of the Olympic Esports Games that are due to be staged in Saudi Arabia. Prince Feisal Al Hussein of Jordan hopes to bring the main Summer Olympics to the Middle East for the first time by shifting the Games from the fierce summer heat in the region. Morinari Watanabe, the Japanese head of gymnastics globally, has proposed staging a single Olympics across the world to provide 24 hours of rolling sports coverage. The vote There will be no final presentation of manifestos before the vote that starts at 2pm UK time until a candidate has an absolute majority. The voters are the 109 people from sport, business, finance and royalty chosen to be IOC members, including Princess Anne and Qatar's emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani. Members are not allowed to vote if any compatriots are still in the running. Candidates can vote for themselves. There won't be a running tally of votes announced between rounds with only the candidate knocked out announced. The winner officially starts on Olympic Day on 23 June when Bach completes his maximum permitted 12 years in office before assuming the newly elected honorary role of life president.

DR Congo also accuses Rwanda of illegally exploiting its mineral deposits in the east of the country, which Rwanda also denies.

What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?The evidence that shows Rwanda is backing rebels in DR Congo

Last December, peace talks brokered by Angola collapsed after Rwanda demanded that the DR Congo government talk directly to the M23.

The rebel group then advanced swiftly, taking control of two key cities - Goma and Bukavu - in the past two months.

According to a joint statement released by Qatar's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday, the two African presidents reaffirmed their commitment to an ""immediate and unconditional"" ceasefire, but it was not clear how that would be implemented or monitored.

""The heads of state then agreed on the need to continue the discussions initiated in Doha in order to establish solid foundations for lasting peace,"" it added. 

The meeting took many by surprise as the two leaders have appeared uncompromising on the conflict often exchanging barbs in public. 

While confirming the talks in the Qatari capital, the Rwandan presidency insisted in a separate statement that direct talks between DR Congo and M23 were ""key to addressing the root causes of the conflict"". 

President Kagame expressed his belief that with ""all parties working together, things can move forward faster"".

DR Congo presidential spokeswoman Tina Salama said on X that the talks were initiated by the Emir of Qatar Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, describing the Gulf nation as a ""strategic ally of the two [African] countries"".

In a presidential statement, the Congolese government said the meeting marked the first step towards a basis for a lasting peace in the volatile east, hinting at further talks. 

The meeting of the two leaders came as a previous attempt to bring DR Congo's government and M23 rebels together for peace talks failed.

Speaking at a joint press conference with the Emir of Qatar, Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani, in Doha, the Russian diplomat added that “just as the [Israeli occupation forces] decided to linger in southern Lebanon, they have now entered southern Syria which gives rise to a new situation.”

He stressed the need to develop constructive steps that take into account the security and development interests of all countries in the region without exception, “including, by all means, Israel”.

“However, security and development issues must not be resolved at the expense of other countries’ security and development,” he added.

Lavrov added that his country is deeply concerned that the Israeli army takes more steps every day that are not provided for in the agreements with Hamas and Lebanon.

“These steps create situations on the ground that are at odds with the existing agreements and UN Security Council resolutions on Palestinian affairs and the Lebanese issue,” he added.

News,QA,post,301633344,2025-03-18,"Congolese, Rwandan leaders meet in Qatar, call for ceasefire in eastern DRC Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame have held direct talks for the first time since Rwanda-backed M23 rebels seized two major cities in eastern DRC.

In a joint statement issued with Qatar, whose emir mediated the talks in Doha, the countries called for an “immediate ceasefire” in eastern DRC.

“The Heads of State then agreed on the need to continue the discussions initiated in Doha in order to establish solid foundations for lasting peace,” the statement said.

The DRC has accused Rwanda of sending weapons and troops to support the M23 rebels, which Rwanda has denied.

The talks came after M23 representatives pulled out of a planned meeting with the DRC government in Angola on Tuesday, after the European Union imposed sanctions on some of the group’s senior members, including leader Bertrand Bisimwa.

In a statement, M23 said the sanctions “seriously compromise direct dialogue and prevent any advance”.

The EU also sanctioned three Rwandan military commanders and the country’s mining agency chief over support for the M23 fighters.

The conflict in eastern DRC escalated in January when the rebels advanced and seized the strategic city of Goma, followed by Bukavu in February.

M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich eastern DRC near the border with Rwanda. The conflict has created one of the world’s most significant humanitarian crises, with more than 7 million people displaced.

The rebels are supported by about 4,000 Rwandan troops, according to United Nations experts.",,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/18/congolese-rwandan-leaders-meet-in-qatar-call-for-ceasefire-in-eastern-drc?traffic_source=rss,,,qatar,,news,,,,,,3,5,,5,,,aljazeera.com,,,,,,,,positive,0.6629480123519897

News,us,post,304920774,2025-03-27,"King Charles admitted to hospital due to ongoing cancer treatment, leading to the cancellation of engagements The King has been forced to cancel a string of engagements after being admitted to hospital today over his ongoing cancer treatment.

The monarch, 72, was tonight back at Clarence House ‘working away as usual’, with sources describing it as a ‘most minor bump in a road that’s very much heading in the right direction’.

However in order to ‘protect and prioritise [his] continued very positive recovery’ he has ‘regretfully’ cancelled a string of engagements in Birmingham tomorrow.

Sources insisted there was ‘no drama’ and described the ‘brief’ trip to hospital this evening as being ‘connected to [his] treatment programme’.

But it is a concerning reminder that more than a year after announcing his had been diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer, that the king is still undergoing treatment while undertaking a busy diary of public engagements.

A source added: ‘As many can vouch, such things are not unexpected with these kind of conditions.’

His Majesty has been able to undertake a full programme of public and State duties, and that position remains unaltered, sources stress.

But today’s side effects did necessitate a brief hospital visit and a few ‘adjustments’ to his immediate diary programme.

In a statement Buckingham Palace said: ‘Following scheduled and ongoing medical treatment for cancer this morning, The King experienced temporary side effects that required a short period of observation in hospital.

‘His Majesty’s afternoon engagements were therefore postponed.

‘His Majesty has now returned to Clarence House and as a precautionary measure, acting on medical advice, tomorrow’s diary programme will also be rescheduled.

‘His Majesty would like to send his apologies to all those who may be inconvenienced or disappointed as a result.’

The King has personally been keen to be as open as possible about his diagnosis, while retaining a sense of medical privacy and was keen to share the latest news in a ‘spirit of openness and transparency’.

No further details of the side effects have been given but they are understood to have been temporary and such issues are not uncommon with many medical treatments.

The King is at home in Clarence House this evening, where he is in ‘good form’, and is continuing to work on State papers and make calls from his study.

He was treated in the London Clinic that has cared for him previously and he travelled to and from the hospital by car in the usual way. The Queen did not join The King during his brief visit to hospital.

A spokesman said of the cancelled engagements: ‘His Majesty was due to receive Credentials from the Ambassadors of three different nations this afternoon. 

‘Tomorrow, he was due to undertake four public engagements in Birmingham and is greatly disappointed to be missing them on this occasion.

‘He very much hopes that they can rescheduled in due course and offers his deepest apologies to all those who had worked so hard to make the planned visit possible.’

Buckingham Palace have indicated there are unlikely to any further updates as it is ‘not a major development’ but will advise on any minor alterations to next week’s diary that may be required in due course.

It is understood the announcement was made so late in the day as the King required time to consult with his staff and medical team about whether tomorrow’s engagements should proceed.

As a precautionary measure, to protect His Majesty’s continued recovery, it was decided that on balance it would be wiser to postpone tomorrow’s engagements.

Charles has been carrying on with his duties despite facing a personally challenging 2024 in which both he and the Princess of Wales were diagnosed with cancer.

The King’s cancer diagnosis was announced in February and he has been receiving treatment for an undisclosed form of the disease as an outpatient. 

He cancelled all face-to-face public duties but returned in April and has since travelled to France for D-Day commemorations, hosted incoming state visits for the Emperor of Japan and the Emir of Qatar, and undertaken a hectic tour to Australia and Samoa with the Queen, despite still undergoing outpatient cancer treatment.

Buckingham Palace have never revealed what cancer the king has – aside to say it was not connected with the prostate surgery he underwent in January which result in doctors discovering the disease – nor details of his treatment. 

However the Mail has previously revealed that it was caught at a very early stage.

It is understood that his treatment is ongoing and the recovery path continues ‘in a very positive direction’.

No major changes to his programme are anticipated but a decision may yet be taken to lighten limited elements of the full planned programme to protect and prioritise His Majesty’s continued recovery, acting on the advice his medical team, and in preparation for the State Visit to Italy in just over a week’s time.

Queen Camilla has spoken of her personal frustration that her adored husband will not slow down. 

But sources say His Majesty’s diary programme is developed in ‘full consultation’ with his medical team at all stages to protect and prioritise his continued recovery.

They stress that the reaction of any patient to medical treatment can be unpredictable and it makes sense to make minor adjustments to plans as necessary.

They also believe undertaking public and State duties has been of great benefit to the King’s overall wellbeing and Charles is ‘deeply grateful’ for all the support, encouragement and kind words of the many thousands he has met while doing so.",,https://internewscast.com/news/us/king-charles-admitted-to-hospital-due-to-ongoing-cancer-treatment-leading-to-the-cancellation-of-engagements/,,,us,,news,,,,,,2,9,,3,,,internewscast.com,,,,,,,,negative,0.9105515480041504
News,us,post,304819732,2025-03-26,"The Limits of Trump’s Deal-making in Afghanistan It was a quick and productive deal. On March 20, U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Response Adam Boehler and former U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad dashed to Kabul and held talks with Amir Khan Muttaqi, the Taliban’s acting foreign minister. This was the first visit by a high-ranking U.S. diplomat to the Afghan capital since the Taliban seized power in 2021. The talks appear to have focused on the release of George Glezmann, an American citizen who had been detained in Afghanistan for more than two years. A day later, Glezmann was released, hurried into a plane to Doha, and then returned to the United States. Days later, the Trump administration returned the favor: It lifted $20 million in bounties on three prominent members of the Haqqani Network, including the Taliban Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani. Glezmann was the third American to be released by the Taliban this year. Not long ago, in January 2025, Secretary of State Marco Rubio had threatened Taliban leadership with a “very big” bounty over American hostages. It now appears that concessions, not intimidation, has helped achieve results. Like all secret deals, whose ex-post revelation generates immense interest, this one, too, came as a surprise. Since little has been revealed, speculations are rife regarding the implications of the release deal brokered by Qatar and the UAE, and whether it marks the dawn of new U.S. policy under Trump toward the Taliban. Commentators have wondered if the U.S. move is a belated attempt to checkmate the growing Chinese influence in Afghanistan or a strategic move to orchestrate an implosion of sorts within the Taliban by undermining their Kandahar-based power center. The Taliban too have contributed to the fog of speculation by highlighting the need for developing “political and economic relations with each other.” Those speculations, however, have little basis. The quick rendezvous between the United States and the Taliban may have ended for the time being. Terrorism is politics, and hence, it shouldn’t be a surprise that on multiple occasions yesterday’s terrorists have been allowed to shed their old clothes and transform themselves into entities capable of being “dealt” with even by democracies. Before the Haqqanis, it was a similar state of play in Syria. Periodic expression of opposition to the Taliban Emir Hibatullah Akhundzada’s regressive policies on girls’ education has contributed to an image makeover for Sirajuddin Haqqani. An individual who plotted countless terror attacks has been portrayed as a reformer of sorts, compared to the Kandahar-based shura that dominates Taliban policymaking. Lifting the bounties on Sirajuddin, his brother, and nephew sends a message that the interior minister is no longer considered a terrorist by the U.S., while several other Taliban leaders will enjoy no such privilege. It is up to Sirajuddin to use this privilege to become an important Taliban contact with the U.S. and subsequently for other countries. Whether he is ready to assume such a role remains an important question. In a bid to become more acceptable, will Sirajuddin mount further challenges to Akhundzada or will he stop short of rocking the boat? In February 2025, Acting Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai mounted a mini-rebellion of sorts by insisting that Akhundzada must remain glued to the path of God. “If you stray even one step from God’s way, you are no longer my leader, and I do not recognize you,” he said in an audio message. Within days, he had fled to the UAE, to protect himself from the wrath of Akhundzada. Reportedly, Sirajuddin played a role in his safe exit from Afghanistan. Although Sirajuddin is a far more influential man than Stanekzai, he may not still be ready to declare war on Kandahar, as yet. Remaining united and professing loyalty to the Taliban supremo have been the group’s main survival techniques. Further, there is little evidence that, despite the successful deal, the U.S. hesitation in normalizing its relations with the Taliban has been overcome. Days before Boehler and Khalilzad’s Kabul trip, Dorothy Shea, the acting U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, emphasized that Washington is distrustful of the Taliban and considers normalizing relations with them to be impossible. “The United States is skeptical of the Taliban’s willingness to engage in good faith in the Doha Process. We cannot build confidence with a group that unjustly detains Americans, has a long history of harboring terrorist groups on its soil, and ignores the basic rights and needs of its own people,” she said on March 10, 2025 at a U.N. Security Council Briefing on Afghanistan. Although Glezmann’s release partly addresses Shea’s list of demands, it is unlikely that the Trump administration will be impressed by the Taliban’s rejection of its demands for the return of weapons left behind by the U.S. forces as they hastily withdrew from Afghanistan in August 2021. The March 2025 Annual Threat Assessment by the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence curiously omits any reference to the Taliban or Afghanistan. However, this may simply suggest that the U.S. is not categorizing Afghanistan as a source of threat to its homeland. The Trump administration’s deep-dive engagement with a host of domestic issues, Russia’s war on Ukraine, the Gaza crisis, Iran, and the Houthis leaves it with little time and motivation to deal with Afghanistan. In 2020, Trump scripted a policy to detach the U.S. from Afghanistan and it is unlikely that he will revisit the policy soon. Eyes must, however, be kept open for any indication of a dialogue – overt or covert – between the Taliban and Washington. Similarly, any further deal for the release of other Americans, like Mahmood Habibi, held by the Taliban, needs to be watched for. During the March 20 meeting, Muttaqi, the Taliban foreign minister, provided a list of demands, including the start of consular services for Afghans in the United States. That would necessitate the U.S. allowing Taliban officials to resume such services on American soil. Even with Trump’s self-avowed proclivity for deal-making, the political and legal complexities surrounding the Taliban’s rule may make even an incremental normalization with the Taliban extremely complicated. Moreover, given his earlier experience of deal-making with the Taliban in Doha in February 2020, the present U.S. administration needs to take stock of the lessons learnt from that flawed deal. It led to the unhindered return of the Taliban in Afghanistan with most of the conditions not being met. The Trump administration would do well to keep that outcome in mind while deal-making in other conflicts.",,https://thediplomat.com/2025/03/the-limits-of-trumps-deal-making-in-kabul/,,,us,,news,,,,,,4,7,,12,,,thediplomat.com,,,,,,,,positive,0.9983388185501099
News,us,post,302425968,2025-03-21,"Sharron Davies criticizes IOC for handling of Lord Coe’s election defeat and challenges new president to prioritize safeguarding women’s sports following controversy at Paris Games. New International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry is facing immediate calls to protect the women’s category after securing a landslide election win.

Double Olympic swimming champion Coventry was elected in the first round of voting on Thursday in Greece to become the first woman to lead the organisation.

The 41-year-old Zimbabwean sports minister earned 49 of the 97 votes cast, with Spain’s Juan Antonio Samaranch her closest challenger on 28.

Coventry was understood to have been the preferred candidate of outgoing president Thomas Bach, with the seven-time Olympic medallist fending off six rivals to secure the most powerful role in sport.

Britain’s Lord Sebastian Coe was among the contenders but polled just eight votes.

Coe had vowed to ‘protect the female category’ as one of his priorities if elected, with his pledge coming after the gender row over Imane Khelif and Lin Yu-ting’s gold medals in the women’s Olympic boxing event at Paris 2024. 

Both have insisted they were born female and neither has ever identified otherwise, but were disqualified from the World Boxing Championship in 2023 for allegedly for failing a gender test. 

Britain’s Sharron Davies, an Olympic silver medallist at Moscow 1980, has urged her fellow swimmer Coventry to follow Coe’s stance in protecting the women’s category following his election.

‘Sad to hear Seb Coe was not elected as IOC president,’ Davies wrote on X. I don’t think IOC are ready for change or transparency. 

‘Seb would have 100% put the athletes first before IOC members allowances & hospitality. Hopefully Kirsty will do as she said before the election & protect women’s sport & we also won’t have the shambles of Paris again where male DSD athletes were allowed to punch females in the face. Pure negligence 

‘Sadly for me Kirsty Coventry has been on the athletes commission for ten years & not spoken up before to protect female athletes coming behind her. But fingers crossed.’

Coventry had pledged in the build-up to the election to protect female athletes, with the 41-year-old stating it would be a ‘priority’.

‘Protecting the female category and female sports is paramount – it’s a priority that we collectively come together,’ Coventry said earlier this year.

‘There is more and more scientific research. We are not having a conversation about how it is detrimental to men’s sport.

‘That, in itself, says we need to protect women’s sport. It is very clear that transgender women are more able in the female category, and can take away opportunities that should be equal for women.’

Coventry, however, had been part of the executive board at the Paris Olympics, where Lin and Khelif won gold.

When questioned about their participation, Coventry claimed lessons would have to be learned. 

‘I don’t believe this is something in hindsight we could have predicted, these boxers had bouts against each other and there hadn’t been previous issues,’ she added.

‘When you have such a sensitive issue being put on the global stage you have to make sure that the athletes are being protected – that their rights are being heard – and that they are being protected on both sides.’

Following her election victory on Thursday, Coventry was pressed further on her stance.

‘My stance is we will protect the female category and female athletes,’ she said. 

‘I want to work together with the international federations and I want the IOC to take up more of a leading role.

‘We are going to bring everyone together to sit down and have a bit more input in the discussion.’

Coventry was widely viewed as the preferred choice of Bach and her victory will lead to dismay among those who had hoped for reform to a much-criticised body. 

Indeed, there had been widespread reports that Bach, who has been in place since 2013, had been lobbying members to casts their votes for Coventry.

Coventry ran on a platform of ‘zero tolerance for corruption… and unethical behaviour’.

Coe was widely-viewed as a more serious reformer and his defeat will disappoint those who were seeking change.

During his time as head of World Athletics, he has overseen the introduction of a robust anti-doping programme, has banned Russian athletes and introduced regulation on the involvement of DSD (difference in Sexual development) and transgender athletes in female categories.

Around 100 IOC members, including the likes of FIFA president Gianni Infantino, the Emir of Qatar and princesses from Liechtenstein and Saudi Arabia, voted at the five-star Westin hotel on the south coast of the Greek mainland.

Also in the race were Prince Feisal al Hussein of Jordan, Johan Eliasch, David Lappartient and Morinari Watanabe.

News,US,post,301542402,2025-03-18,"Trump pulls the plug on Voice of America &mdash; but Russia and China keep their government-funded broadcasters on air President Donald Trump effectively shut down Voice of America last Friday with an executive order.The order eliminated seven government entities not mandated by law, including VOA's parent, the US Agency for Global Media.It placed more than 1,300 journalists, producers, and support staff on administrative leave, ending a government-funded broadcasting service founded during World War II to counter Nazi propaganda.Russian and Chinese state-run media welcomed Trump's move last week, with the Global Times calling VOA a ""lie factory,"" while RT editor in chief Margarita Simonyan praised Trump's ""awesome decision.""While VOA's broadcasts have ceased and its website gone dark, its Russian and Chinese equivalents are very much alive and kicking.Here's a closer look at them along with other government-funded broadcasters.The Moscow-backed news channel RT, formerly called Russia Today, was barred from the European Union, the UK, and Canada following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Meta's social media platforms and YouTube, along with TikTok, followed suit weeks later, blocking access to RT and Sputnik in the EU.The US imposed a raft of sanctions against RT under the Biden administration, accusing it of engaging in ""information operations, covert influence, and military procurement"" abroad.In September 2024, the US Department of Justice charged two RT employees with money laundering and reportedly paying $10 million to an unnamed Tennessee-based company to produce English-language social media videos aimed at stirring up political divisions.A US intelligence official told Reuters that RT had ""built and used networks of US and other Western personalities to create and disseminate Russia-friendly narratives"" ahead of last year's presidential election won by Donald Trump.Funding: RT received about $360 million in Russian government subsidies in 2020.CCTV, part of the China Global Television Network (CGTN), serves as China's state-run international broadcaster, delivering news and other programming.CGTN operates channels in languages including English, Spanish, French, Arabic, and Russian, to amplify Beijing's global messaging.It is under the control of the Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party.Funding: CGTN is secretive about its budget, but Beijing allocated $6.6 billion in 2018 to expand its foreign-language media including CGTN, The Economist reported.The BBC World Service is the UK's international broadcaster, providing news in more than 40 languages to a global audience of some to 365 million.In January 2025, it faced funding and job cuts as part of cost cuts, raising concerns about its ability to counter disinformation from state-funded media from the likes of Russia and China.The UK government increased its funding for the World Service in November by about $42 million for the 2025/26 financial year.Funding: The World Service's funding comes mostly from the ""license fee"" paid by British viewers, as well as some government grants. BBC executives are advocating for full state funding to ensure its sustainability and effectiveness in countering global disinformation. Deutsche Welle is Germany's international broadcaster and operates in 32 languages, including English, Spanish, and Arabic.It aims to provide unbiased news and promote understanding between cultures.Funding: DW is funded by the German federal tax budget and received about $447 million in federal funding in 2024.France 24 is France's international news channel, broadcasting in French, English, Arabic, and Spanish to a weekly average of 101.7 million viewers in 2022.It provides global news coverage with a French perspective.Funding: France 24 is part of France Médias Monde, which received a state subsidy of about $331 million in 2024.Al Jazeera, based in Qatar, is a broadcaster known for its extensive coverage of global events, particularly in the Middle East.The network was established in 1996 with a $150 million government loan from Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, then-emir of Qatar.It offers news in multiple languages and has established itself as a significant player in international media.Funding: Al Jazeera is partially funded by the Qatari government, which supports its operations and global news coverage, but has consistently asserted its editorial independence.",,https://www.businessinsider.com/voice-of-america-trump-russia-china-broadcasters-rt-cctv-2025-3,,,us,,news,,,,,,5,14,,2,,,businessinsider.com,,,,,,,,negative,0.9878537654876709

Sure. You don't know until you're there. Culture shock. Homesickness.

I knew a psychologist that positioned himself to test potential employees for overseas assignments. Companies didn't want to spend the money to move an employee and their families only to lose money on high rotation and training.

Two problems... one you picked France without learning French ""French"". The French are notorious for being snobs a out their dialects.

Just like you don't speak Mexican Spanish to a Spaniard and expect it to work. You don't speak Candian or American French to a Frenchperson. Even the primary language of my chosen escape German has its variations. Everyone is expected to know HochDeutsche, but the regional variations can throw you.

Almost right out of college I took a job in American Samoa. The culture shock was fun at first, but that level of Polynesian culture is frustrating to live in. Nothing works right, and no one cares. The top speed limit is 25 MPH, but people do under that all the time, and my entre 30-minute commute to work had maybe a quarter-mile of passing zone. Another thing was that my job didn't pay enough for me to visit the surrounding countries very much, which one of my group of first-world expat friends said was crucial to staying sane there. I started loosely thinking about leaving nine months in. Then a tsunami hit, and things were at least interesting enough that I didn't get back to thinking about it for another few months. It also didn't help that eligible women my age were few and far between.

The thing that made me really decide to leave was my car breaking down, and the farking dealermechanic fried the central computer while ""fixing"" it. Then I took it to another mechanic, and that guy, actually a white dude from the mainland, needed six farking months and online research from me to get it done. I'd call in for updates and he'd say he hadn't gotten around to it that week.

I love American Samoa, and my time there is one of my favorite topics in the world. Was just thinking about how if I could visit anywhere in the world. I'd like to show it and the more tourist-friendly Independent Samoa to my wife. But I'd only live there again for an insane amount of money.

I've lived in other countries for over 8 years total. Not visited, but actually lived in foreign countries.

One does get homesick. One does miss loved ones and family. But I enjoyed my times overseas, even two tours in Korea, with one exception. And I would live in another country without hesitation like France and many others.

The only place I just couldn't wait to escape from was Qatar. Doha is just a city in a massive desert, ruled by an emir and a tribe. The rest are paid servants who do not enjoy equality under Qatari law. I just went there for the high pay. I won't go back to the Middle East as it's ruled primarily by kings, emirs, dictators, and religious extremists, including Israel.

-she went to a different country to make a better life for herself and her family in good faith
-she played by their rules and adapted to their culture for the most part

News,us,post,296754404,2025-03-05,"The Arab Plan to Save Gaza Has One Major Flaw The highly anticipated Egypt-drafted plan endorsed by Arab powers as a counterproposal to President Donald Trump's calls for the expulsion of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip outlines a new pathway to peace, reconstruction and eventual Palestinian statehood that excludes Hamas from power.But there's one major flaw, according to Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank and a Gaza native who reviewed the 106-page document firsthand. It never actually mentions Hamas.""You have the word 'administrative,' you have the word 'reconstruct.' It uses words like 'genocide.' It uses words like 'ethnic cleansing.' It uses all these sharp words for Israel and that's typical of diplomacy, if you will,"" Alkhatib told Newsweek. ""But if you look at the actual language, the actual verbiage for Hamas, there's nothing.""He argued that the plan, which otherwise constituted a ""nice vision for rebuilding Gaza,"" did debut two points that could prove useful in advancing negotiations toward a lasting peace in Gaza after 16 months of conflict.These include the formation of an administrative committee of independent Palestinians to temporarily lead the territory until ostensibly handing power to a reformed Palestinian National Authority (PA). It also discusses the deployment of an international peacekeeping force not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank, where the PA currently leads in limited fashion, increasingly isolated from Hamas-led Gaza.Yet empowering independent Palestinians to take the reins from Hamas in Gaza may prove difficult, Alkhatib said, ""if Arabs from afar aren't even willing to talk about Hamas.""Newsweek has reached out to Hamas and the Israeli Consulate General in New York for comment.Hamas has been in control of Gaza since seizing the territory amid a violent split with the PA's top Fatah faction in 2007. A year earlier, in the wake of Israel's withdrawal from Gaza, Hamas came out with the highest share of votes in the last Palestinian elections to ever be held, but Fatah refused to participate in the short-lived unity government and soaring tensions devolved into clashes in which Hamas also emerged victorious.Since then, Hamas has previously signaled that it would be willing to cede power in Gaza, but only in the event that a new unified government was chosen by Palestinians. Hamas and Fatah agreed to similar terms in 2017, but negotiations again soon unraveled.One senior Hamas leader recently told Newsweek that there were two paths through which the group would hand over power.""We are ready to leave the administration of Gaza to any national unity government that represents all Palestinians, not necessarily politically, and with specific tasks, which are reconstruction, the unification of institutions and the preparation for elections to reform the Palestinian political system,"" the senior Hamas leader said.""Or we can go with the Egyptian option, which is to form a special body for the Gaza Strip of technocratic professionals who represent all the sons of the Palestinian people, not necessarily the factions, to manage the affairs of the Gaza Strip,"" the senior Hamas official added. ""Therefore, remaining in power is not a goal for Hamas, but Hamas will not leave the Gaza Strip to chaos and tampering.""The latter plan appears to more closely mirror the current proposal put forth by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and also endorsed Tuesday by the king of Jordan, the emir of Qatar, the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, the vice president of the United Arab Emirates and other representatives of Arab League states at an emergency summit in Cairo.The urgent gathering and the timely rollout of the plan was largely a reaction to Trump's drastic shift on U.S. policy toward the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The U.S. leader who has taken credit for the ceasefire deal first outlined by his predecessor in May 2023 and later adopted just days before his inauguration has proposed not only transferring Gaza's 2 million residents to ""beautiful communities"" elsewhere, but also the U.S. assuming direct control of the devastated territory. The end goal would be to transform Gaza into a ""Riviera of the Middle East,"" a vision advertised in a tongue-in-cheek AI-generated video released by Trump last week.Trump's approach has generated substantial controversy and condemnation throughout the Arab world, but it has also garnered some support in Israel, particularly among far-right factions crucial to Netanyahu's ruling coalition. Furthermore, Trump has said he told the Israeli premier, ""You do whatever you want,"" as it relates to whether or not to maintain the ceasefire or resume the war.Negotiations toward phase two of the ceasefire agreement have yet to commence and Netanyahu has warned he was prepared to restart operations in Gaza if Hamas did not continue to release hostages. Of the roughly 251 people taken captive during Hamas' October 2023 attack, nearly 50 are believed to remain in the group's hands, the majority of which are believed to be dead.While Netanyahu has yet to officially react to the new Arab proposal, Alkhatib felt the omission of Hamas could prove a nonstarter for Israel, which has also voiced opposition toward allowing the PA to rule in Gaza.""[Netanyahu and his government] want to have the sole security purview over Gaza, so they're already highly suspicious of the Egyptians, the Arabs, of anything other than the Israelis,"" Alkhatib said. ""So, to come up with a plan that doesn't address Hamas, I think, just further feeds their paranoia that 'We can't trust anyone, we can only and exclusively engage with ourselves and the Americans to basically give us a blank check to do whatever we want,' and that the Arabs and the Palestinian Authority will never be in a position to be of security assistance.""On the other hand, Alkhatib felt there may more of a chance to win over Trump, who despite being likely ""to defer to the Israelis,"" also may also ""look to this as an opportunity to engage the Saudis"" at a time when the White House was looking to build upon its Abraham Accords legacy. His negotiating team, including Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, could also use the plan as a vehicle for maintaining the kind of calm Trump has promised for the region.""That might be the play here,"" Alkhatib said, ""to say, 'This plan right here gives us enough cover to say this is how we're going to reconstruct Gaza, this is how we're going to end the war and this is how we're going to get more hostages brought back until we make it to phase three,' which might actually end up being where the war resolves.""The stakes for the plan are particularly high, however, not only for the sake of ending the longest and deadliest clash of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to date, but also for determining whether or not the two-state solution remains a viable path forward after decades of frustrated diplomacy.""I absolutely think that this plan, tactically speaking, may be the last attempt to stabilize what remains of the Palestinian people on their land, what remains of the Palestinians territories, what remains of the Palestinian Authority, such that we could even keep talk of the two-state solution alive,"" Alkhatib said.Should it fail, he said, ""I think it really is the end of any real connectivity between Gaza and the West Bank, I think it's the end of any real dominion that the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority will have over the Gaza Strip and the beginning of a long, drawn-out battle of attrition and counterinsurgency campaign by the IDF against Hamas that will inevitably start either now or, if some of this is in a token manner adopted, after the end of phase two.""",,https://www.newsweek.com/arab-plan-save-gaza-has-one-major-flaw-2039683,,,us,,news,,,,,,8,6,,5,,,newsweek.com,,,,,,,,negative,0.9959779977798462
News,us,post,296749398,2025-03-04,"Egypt says Arab leaders have endorsed a counterproposal to Trump's Gaza plan CAIRO -- Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said Friday that Arab leaders have endorsed Egypt's postwar plan for the Gaza Strip that would allow its roughly 2 million Palestinians to remain in the territory. 

Meeting in Cairo on Tuesday, the leaders endorsed a counterproposal to President Donald Trump’s plan to depopulate the territory and redevelop it as a beach destination. It was unclear if Israel or the United States would accept the Egyptian plan.

THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.

Arab leaders meeting in Cairo on Tuesday are set to endorse a counterproposal to U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for the Gaza Strip to be depopulated and transformed into a beach destination, even as the continuation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire is uncertain.

The summit hosted by Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi included the emir of Qatar, the vice president of the United Arab Emirates and the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia — countries whose support is crucial for any postwar plan. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres also attended.

Israel has embraced what it says is an alternative U.S. proposal for the ceasefire itself and the release of hostages taken in Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the war. Israel has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to try to get Hamas to accept the new proposal and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting.

The suspension of aid drew widespread criticism, with human rights groups saying that it violated Israel's obligations as an occupying power under international law.

The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group’s main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase.

A 112-page draft of Egypt's $53 billion plan obtained by The Associated Press foresees rebuilding Gaza by 2030 without removing its population. The first phase calls for starting the removal of unexploded ordnance and clearing the more than 50 million tons of rubble left by Israel’s bombardment and military offensives.

Hundreds of thousands of temporary housing units would be set up where Gaza’s population could live while reconstruction takes place. The rubble would be recycled, with some of it used as infill to create expanded lands on Gaza’s Mediterranean coast.

In the following years, the plan envisages completely reshaping the strip, building “sustainable, green and walkable” housing and urban areas, with renewable energy. It renovates agricultural lands and creates industrial zones and large park areas.

It also calls for the opening of an airport, a fishing port and a commercial port. The Oslo peace accords in the 1990s called for the opening of an airport and a commercial port in Gaza, but the projects withered as the peace process collapsed.

Under the plan, Hamas would cede power to an interim administration of political independents until a reformed Palestinian Authority can assume control. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Western-backed authority and an opponent of Hamas, was attending the summit. 

Israel has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and, along with the United States, has demanded Hamas’ disarmament. Hamas, which doesn't accept Israel's existence, has said it's willing to cede power in Gaza to other Palestinians, but won't give up its arms until there is a Palestinian state.

Addressing the summit, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said that the plan “preserves the right of Palestinian people in rebuilding their nation and guarantees their existence on their land.”

He said there is a need for a parallel path for peace to achieve a “comprehensive, just and lasting settlement” to the Palestinian cause.

“There will be no true peace without the establishment of the Palestinian state,” el-Sissi said. “It’s time to adopt the launching of a serious and effective political path that leads to a permanent and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause according to the resolutions of international legitimacy.”

An early draft of the statement endorsing the plan called for a “permanent and just solution” for the Palestinian cause, and for the U.N. Security Council to deploy international peacekeepers in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The mention of peacekeepers was dropped from a later draft.

Israel has vowed to maintain open-ended security control over both territories, which it captured in the 1967 Mideast war and which Palestinians want for their future state. Israel’s government and most of its political class are opposed to Palestinian statehood.

Trump shocked the region last month when he suggested Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians be resettled in other countries. He said the United States would take ownership of the territory and redevelop it into a Middle Eastern “Riviera.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embraced the proposal, which was roundly rejected by Palestinians, Arab countries and human rights experts, who said it would likely violate international law.

A senior European Union official attending the summit said the bloc was ready to provide “concrete support” for Egypt's plan.

“The European Union firmly rejects any attempt at demographic or territorial changes, in Gaza, in other parts of the world. Anywhere,” Antonio Costa, president of the European Commission, told the summit.

The EU, he said, is “committed to the two-state solution, where Palestine and Israel can live side-by-side in peace and security.”

Riccardo Fabiani, North Africa director at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, said the summit is “a key pillar in Egypt’s strategy” to counter Trump's plan for Gaza.

“Egypt is trying to present a credible alternative focused on reconstruction and an indirect consultation mechanism for Hamas that could reassure Israel and the US,” he said. “The idea is also to continue to frame this plan as part of a new push towards the two-state solution.”

Trump has suggested that Egypt and Jordan, two close American allies, could take in large numbers of Palestinian refugees from Gaza. Both countries have adamantly rejected any such plan. 

Meeting with Trump at the White House last month, King Abdullah II of Jordan offered to take in around 2,000 children for medical treatment. The first group of around 30 children left Gaza for Jordan on Tuesday, according to Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The children are being accompanied by up to two family members.

Jordan said that the children are amputees and will return to Gaza when their treatment is complete. The kingdom has also set up field hospitals in Gaza and delivered aid by air and land.

The war began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 people hostage. Hamas-led militants are still holding 59 hostages, 35 of whom are believed to be dead.

Most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements. Israel has rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more.

Israel's 15-month offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It doesn't say how many were fighters, but the ministry says women and children made up more than half the dead. Israel says it killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.

The offensive destroyed large areas of Gaza, including much of its health system and other infrastructure. At its height, the war displaced about 90% of the population, mostly within the territory, where hundreds of thousands packed into squalid tent camps and schools repurposed as shelters.

CAIRO (AP) — Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said Tuesday that Arab leaders have endorsed Egypt’s postwar plan for the Gaza Strip that would allow its roughly 2 million Palestinians to remain in the territory.

Meeting in Cairo on Tuesday, the leaders endorsed a counterproposal to President Donald Trump’s plan to depopulate the territory and redevelop it as a beach destination. It was unclear if Israel or the United States would accept the Egyptian plan.

The summit hosted by Egypt included the emir of Qatar, the vice president of the United Arab Emirates and the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia — countries whose support is crucial for any postwar plan. U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres also attended.

Israel has embraced what it says is an alternative U.S. proposal for the ceasefire itself and the release of hostages taken in Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which triggered the war. Israel has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to try to get Hamas to accept the new proposal and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting.

Hamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada and the European Union.

The suspension of aid drew widespread criticism, with human rights groups saying that it violated Israel’s obligations as an occupying power under international law.

The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the group’s main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase.

Egypt’s postwar plan

A 112-page draft of Egypt’s $53 billion plan obtained by The Associated Press foresees rebuilding Gaza by 2030 without removing its population. The first phase calls for starting the removal of unexploded ordnance and clearing the more than 50 million tons of rubble left by Israel’s bombardment and military offensives.

Hundreds of thousands of temporary housing units would be set up where Gaza’s population could live while reconstruction takes place. The rubble would be recycled, with some of it used as infill to create expanded lands on Gaza’s Mediterranean coast.

In the following years, the plan envisages completely reshaping the strip, building “sustainable, green and walkable” housing and urban areas, with renewable energy. It renovates agricultural lands and creates industrial zones and large park areas.

It also calls for the opening of an airport, a fishing port and a commercial port. The Oslo peace accords in the 1990s called for the opening of an airport and a commercial port in Gaza, but the projects withered as the peace process collapsed.

Under the plan, Hamas would cede power to an interim administration of political independents until a reformed Palestinian Authority can assume control. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Western-backed authority and an opponent of Hamas, was attending the summit.

The King has now returned to Clarence House but has received medical advice to reschedule his planned engagements.

Here is the timeline of the health troubles facing the royal family.

News,gb,post,304916948,2025-03-27,"King Charles is admitted to hospital amid his ongoing cancer battle and is forced to cancel engagements The King has been forced to cancel a string of engagements after being admitted to hospital today over his ongoing cancer treatment.

The monarch, 72, was tonight back at Clarence House 'working away as usual', with sources describing it as a 'most minor bump in a road that's very much heading in the right direction'.

However in order to 'protect and prioritise [his] continued very positive recovery' he has 'regretfully' cancelled a string of engagements in Birmingham tomorrow.

Sources insisted there was 'no drama' and described the 'brief' trip to hospital this evening as being 'connected to [his] treatment programme'.

But it is a concerning reminder that more than a year after announcing his had been diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer, that the king is still undergoing treatment while undertaking a busy diary of public engagements.

A source added: 'As many can vouch, such things are not unexpected with these kind of conditions.'

In a statement Buckingham Palace said: 'Following scheduled and ongoing medical treatment for cancer this morning, The King experienced temporary side effects that required a short period of observation in hospital.

'His Majesty's afternoon engagements were therefore postponed.

'His Majesty has now returned to Clarence House and as a precautionary measure, acting on medical advice, tomorrow's diary programme will also be rescheduled.

'His Majesty would like to send his apologies to all those who may be inconvenienced or disappointed as a result.'

His Majesty has been able to undertake a full programme of public and State duties, and that position remains unaltered, sources stress.

But today's side effects did necessitate a brief hospital visit and a few 'adjustments' to his immediate diary programme.

The King has personally been keen to be as open as possible about his diagnosis, while retaining a sense of medical privacy and was keen to share the latest news in a 'spirit of openness and transparency.

No further details of the side effects have been given but they are understood to have been temporary and such issues are not uncommon with many medical treatments.

The King is at home in Clarence House this evening, where he is in 'good form', and is continuing to work on State papers and make calls from his study.

He was treated in the London Clinic that has cared for him previously and he travelled to and from the hospital by car in the usual way.

The Queen did not join The King during his brief visit to hospital.

A spokesman said of the cancelled engagements: 'His Majesty was due to receive Credentials from the Ambassadors of three different nations this afternoon. 

'Tomorrow, he was due to undertake four public engagements in Birmingham and is greatly disappointed to be missing them on this occasion.

'He very much hopes that they can rescheduled in due course and offers his deepest apologies to all those who had worked so hard to make the planned visit possible.'

Charles has been carrying on with his duties despite facing a personally challenging 2024 in which both he and the Princess of Wales were diagnosed with cancer.

News of Charles' cancer, undisclosed in its form, came in February, after it was discovered while he was treated in hospital for an enlarged prostate in January.

He cancelled all face-to-face public duties but returned in April and has since travelled to France for D-Day commemorations, hosted incoming state visits for the Emperor of Japan and the Emir of Qatar, and undertaken a hectic tour to Australia and Samoa with the Queen, despite still undergoing outpatient cancer treatment.

The King's cancer diagnosis was announced in February and he has been receiving treatment for an undisclosed form of the disease as an outpatient.

Buckingham Palace have never revealed what cancer the king has - aside to say it was not connected with the prostate surgery he underwent in January which result in doctors discovering the disease - nor details of his treatment. 

However the Mail has previously revealed that it was caught at a very early stage.

It is understood that his treatment is ongoing and the recovery path continues 'in a very positive direction'.",,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14544879/King-Charles-admitted-hospital.html,,,uk,,news,,,,,,2,3,,12,,,dailymail.co.uk,,,,,,,,negative,0.9960581064224243
News,gb,post,296979984,2025-03-05,"Arab leaders agree Egypt’s plan for Hamas-free Gaza Arab leaders, including Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, have endorsed a $53billion Gaza reconstruction programme that sees no future for Hamas in governing the Strip. The deal, proposed by Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, introduced the “Early Recovery, Reconstruction, and Development of Gaza” scheme at an Arab League summit in Cairo on Tuesday. The Emir of Qatar, King of Bahrain’s, Vice President of the UAE and Saudi Foreign Minister attended the Cairo conference, as did UN Secretary-General António Guterres. The 106-page proposal, which carries an estimated $53 billion price tag, envisions rebuilding Gaza without displacing its people – a sharp contrast to US President Donald Trump’s vision of a ""Middle East Riviera"" that promotes large-scale infrastructure development and relocation of the two million-strong populus. The Egyptian plan calls for the establishment of temporary housing for Gaza's displaced people, the removal of unexploded ordnance and the clearing of the over 50 million tons of rubble left by the latest Israeli military operations. It also aims to reshape the Strip over the long term with sustainable housing, renewable energy and plans for industrial zones, parks, and commercial ports. The plan includes the long-sought goal of opening a fishing port and an airport in Gaza – projects that were outlined in the Oslo Accords but have never been fully realised. Speaking at the summit, President al-Sisi expressed optimism about the potential for peace, stating, he was certain that US president Donald Trump would be able to achieve a settlement on what he referred to as the Palestinian issue. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, present at the summit, voiced his support for the Arab-led initiative. “I welcome and strongly endorse the Arab-led initiative to mobilize support for Gaza’s reconstruction, clearly expressed in this summit,” he said. “The UN stands ready to fully cooperate in this endeavor.” However, the plan raised questions about Gaza’s future leadership, particularly the role of Hamas. While the Egyptian proposal does not directly mention Hamas, it emphasises that independent Palestinian technocrats, unaffiliated with the group, would take control of the territory once hostilities end. The US and Israel are expected to push back against the proposal, with both states favouring President Trump’s alternative. Indeed, US National Security Council spokesperson Brian Hughes issued a statement rejecting the Egyptian draft, saying: “[The plan] does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance. ""President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas. We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region."" Trump’s ""vision” focuses on the complete dismantling of Hamas, emphasising a future where the region is free from the militant group's influence. The US sees this as essential for peace and stability in the broader Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also embraced Trump’s approach, affirming Israel’s commitment to the plan. In a statement, Israel’s Foreign Ministry said the Egyptian plan “fails to address the realities of the situation.” It reiterated Israel’s support for Trump’s plan to resettle Gaza’s population elsewhere, describing it as “an opportunity for the Gazans to have free choice based on their free will,” a day after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu again gave his full-throated backing to the proposal, calling it “visionary and innovative.” Meanwhile Hamas itself has rejected external involvement in Gaza’s future. In a statement, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem stressed the importance of national consensus in deciding Gaza’s reconstruction and governance. ""Any plans for Gaza’s future must come through national consensus,"" Qassem said. The terror group will only accept an Arab-led plan for postwar reconstruction of Gaza that wins the support of Palestinians in the enclave, rejecting “external forces” determining the future of the Strip, he added. Hamas has also made it clear that disarmament is not on the table. Senior Hamas figure Sami Abu Zuhri reiterated that the group and other Palestinian factions would not relinquish their weapons, declaring that ""any talk about the resistance’s weapons is nonsense. The resistance’s weapons are a red line for Hamas and all resistance factions"".",,https://www.thejc.com/news/israel/arab-leaders-agree-egypt-plan-gaza-uwx9doba,,,uk,,news,,,,,,2,15,,3,,,thejc.com,,,,,,,,positive,0.7496215105056763
News,gb,post,296695090,2025-03-04,"Egypt says Arab leaders have endorsed a counter-proposal to Trump’s Gaza plan Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said that Arab leaders have endorsed Egypt’s post-war plan for the Gaza Strip that would allow its two million Palestinians to remain in the territory.

Meeting in Cairo on Tuesday, the leaders endorsed a counter-proposal to President Donald Trump’s plan to depopulate the territory and redevelop it as a beach destination.

It was unclear if Israel or the United States would accept the Egyptian plan.

The summit hosted by Egypt included the emir of Qatar, the vice president of the United Arab Emirates and the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia — countries whose support is crucial for any post-war plan. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres also attended.

Israel has embraced what it says is an alternative US proposal for the ceasefire itself and the release of hostages taken in Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which triggered the war.

Israel has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to try to get Hamas to accept the new proposal and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting.

The suspension of aid drew widespread criticism, with human rights groups saying that it violated Israel’s obligations as an occupying power under international law.

The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group’s main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce.

Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase.

A 112-page draft of Egypt’s 53 billion dollars plan obtained by The Associated Press foresees rebuilding Gaza by 2030 without removing its population.

The first phase calls for starting the removal of unexploded ordnance and clearing the more than 50 million tons of rubble left by Israel’s bombardment and military offensives.

Hundreds of thousands of temporary housing units would be set up where Gaza’s population could live while reconstruction takes place. The rubble would be recycled, with some of it used as infill to create expanded lands on Gaza’s Mediterranean coast.

In the following years, the plan envisages completely reshaping the strip, building “sustainable, green and walkable” housing and urban areas, with renewable energy. It renovates agricultural lands and creates industrial zones and large park areas.

It also calls for the opening of an airport, a fishing port and a commercial port. The Oslo peace accords in the 1990s called for the opening of an airport and a commercial port in Gaza, but the projects withered as the peace process collapsed.

Under the plan, Hamas would cede power to an interim administration of political independents until a reformed Palestinian Authority can assume control.

Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Western-backed authority and an opponent of Hamas, was attending the summit.

Israel has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and, along with the United States, has demanded Hamas’ disarmament.

Hamas, which does not accept Israel’s existence, has said it is willing to cede power in Gaza to other Palestinians, but will not give up its arms until there is a Palestinian state.

Addressing the summit, Mr el-Sissi said that the plan “preserves the right of Palestinian people in rebuilding their nation and guarantees their existence on their land.”

He said there is a need for a parallel path for peace to achieve a “comprehensive, just and lasting settlement” to the Palestinian cause.

“There will be no true peace without the establishment of the Palestinian state,” Mr el-Sissi said. “It’s time to adopt the launching of a serious and effective political path that leads to a permanent and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause according to the resolutions of international legitimacy.”

An early draft of the statement endorsing the plan called for a “permanent and just solution” for the Palestinian cause, and for the UN Security Council to deploy international peacekeepers in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The mention of peacekeepers was dropped from a later draft.

Israel has vowed to maintain open-ended security control over both territories, which it captured in the 1967 Mideast war and which Palestinians want for their future state. Israel’s government and most of its political class are opposed to Palestinian statehood.

Mr Trump shocked the region last month when he suggested Gaza’s roughly two million Palestinians be resettled in other countries.

He said the United States would take ownership of the territory and redevelop it into a Middle Eastern “Riviera.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embraced the proposal, which was roundly rejected by Palestinians, Arab countries and human rights experts, who said it would likely violate international law.

Riccardo Fabiani, North Africa director at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, said the summit is “a key pillar in Egypt’s strategy” to counter Mr Trump’s plan for Gaza.

“Egypt is trying to present a credible alternative focused on reconstruction and an indirect consultation mechanism for Hamas that could reassure Israel and the US,” he said. “The idea is also to continue to frame this plan as part of a new push towards the two-state solution.”",,https://jerseyeveningpost.com/morenews/worldnews/2025/03/04/egypt-says-arab-leaders-have-endorsed-a-counter-proposal-to-trumps-gaza-plan/,,,uk,,news,,,,,,3,8,,11,,,jerseyeveningpost.com,,,,,,,,neutral,0.5603561401367188

Editor's note: This episode was recorded on March 4, 2025.
In Syria, Assad is gone, but the country's challenges remain. Over a decade of civil war and foreign intervention has devastated the country's economy and politics, but a fragile optimism still exists. Joseph Daher and Ramah Kudaimi join this second episode of Solidarity Without Exception for a discussion on Syria's long journey from the 2011 revolution to today, and what solidarity with the Syrian people should have looked like then, and could look like now.

Ashley Smith:
Welcome to Solidarity Without Exception. I'm Ashley Smith, who along with Blanca Missé are co-hosts of this ongoing podcast series. Today we're joined by Joseph Daher and Ramah Kudaimi to discuss the toppling of Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria. Joseph is a Swiss Syrian socialist, professor and author of Hezbollah: The Political Economy of Lebanon's Party of God, Syria After the Uprising, and Palestine and Marxism. He recently returned from a visit to Syria only to find out that he has been fired from his university post for organizing in solidarity with Palestine. Ramah is a Syrian American activist and the campaign director for the Crescendo Project at the Action Center on Race and the Economy Institute. Ramah was previously the deputy director at the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, where she led and supported BDS campaigns in solidarity with the Palestinian people's struggle for freedom, justice, and equality.
In this episode, we'll discuss Syria's revolutionary process, which began in 2011 as part of the Arab Spring, when people revolted against the autocratic governments throughout the Middle East and North Africa. In Syria, people rose up against Assad's regime in a mass revolutionary struggle for democracy and equality. In response, Assad launched a counter-revolutionary war on his people to defend his rule. There is no doubt that he would have fallen without the military support of Russia, Iran, and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Together, they jailed, killed, bombed, and terrorized the country's people driving millions into exile and internal displacement. Nevertheless, Assad lost control over whole sections of the country. Rebels led by the Islamic fundamentalist groups like Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham that dominated the military resistance, seized control over some sections of Syria, while Kurdish-led forces in the Syrian defense forces declared a liberated zone in Rojava.
The US intervened in Syria against ISIS. When the group took over whole swaths of the country, Washington did back some Syrian rebels, including the Kurds, but restricted them to fighting ISIS, not the regime. In fact, the US wanted to preserve the regime as a bulwark of stability in the region. At best, hoping for a more pliant ruler to replace Assad. With that not in the cards, states throughout the region and world began to normalize relationships with Assad. But the regime's days were numbered. It had little to no domestic support, and its foreign backers became weakened and preoccupied. Israel bombed Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah as part of their expansion of its genocidal war on Palestine. Meanwhile, Russia got bogged down in its own imperialist war on Ukraine.
Without support from these regional and imperialist powers, the regime began to teeter and was finally toppled by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army and local popular militias. This has opened a new day in Syria, one that offers hope to rekindle the dreams of the original popular uprising, but also dangers posed by the Islamic fundamentalist forces now in power and the schemes of regional powers like Turkey and Israel. These two possible trajectories have been on display after this episode was recorded.
On the one hand, the country's new Islamic fundamentalist regime deployed its security forces in Latakia against holdout supporters of Assad in the mainly Alawite community. That encouraged sectarian attacks against the Alawite community that killed hundreds of people and drove many more from their homes in the worst sectarian violence since the fall of the regime. On the other hand, the new regime reached an accord with the Kurdish-led Syrian defense forces, which controls about 30% of the country. They agreed to unite their forces, declare a ceasefire, recognize Kurds as an Indigenous community entitled to citizenship and constitutional rights, and oppose attempts to sow sectarian strife between Syria's different ethnic and religious communities.
This accord is an enormous step forward for the Syrian people and a devastating setback to both Turkey and Israel's attempt to divide the country. Thus, the future of Syria hangs in the balance between hope and horror, between an inclusive, democratic and egalitarian future and another of sectarian division, violence and social decomposition. What the masses of the country's people do will determine whether the original hope of the revolution encapsulated in its slogan, the Syrian People Are One, will be fulfilled. Now on to the discussion with Joseph and Ramah, who provide crucial context for understanding the country's ongoing struggle for liberation, democracy and equality.
So obviously the biggest news out of Syria is the toppling of Assad's regime. And I think everybody around the world, and obviously the overwhelming majority of Syrians were overjoyed about the overthrow and end of his horrific rule in power. So just to give us some background on the nature of his regime and also about the impact of the regime on the country's people and how people responded to the fall of his regime. Maybe we could start with Joseph, because I know you were just in Syria, so you can give us an on-the-ground sense of that.
Joseph Daher:
To tell you honestly, since the 8th of December, it's been kind of a dream following the fall of the Assad dynasty, a family that ruled Syria for 54 years. And obviously, there are a lot of challenges for the future of Syria. But as I've been saying, ability only to speak about these challenges is a big way forward. For the vast majority of the Syrian population, the ability to organize, the ability to organize conferences. For example, when I was in Syria, I was able to visit Damascus, Suwayda, Aleppo, and just the ability to go back to Syria. For a lot of people, it was not a total of possibility. I never thought I would be able to go back. I was saying there was this Syrian women political movement doing their first press conference. There have been a lot of local popular organizations will come back to this, so there's a lot of dynamism.
But this is not to deny as well the huge challenges for a country that suffered 13 years of war, massive destructions, 90% of the population live under the poverty line. Still the influence of foreign forces. And obviously the new actor in power that is far from being democratic, and I know we'll come back to this, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham. Now coming back to the nature of the, and it's very nice to be able to say this, to the former regime, the Assad regime, it was, again, Hafez al-Assad built a new patrimonial state which was authoritarian, liberalizing the economy slowly, and there was an acceleration after Bashar al-Assad, but he put the basis, if we want, or the pillars of authoritarianism, despotism. And for the first time in decades, Syrians were able, for example, to celebrate or to commemorate the massacre of Hama that killed tens of thousands of people openly in '82. So there was a complete oppression and criminalization of all forms of opposition.
Bashar al-Assad completed, if you want, the patrimonialism of this regime, the centers of power concentrated within a small group, and this was only deepened with the war. And this is one of the reasons why actually the Assad regime fell as a house of cards, that no one wanted to defend a regime in which oppression was the rule, exploitation was the rule, and 90% lived under the poverty line. And soldiers did not fight. There was no major confrontations in the fall of the Assad regime. And this regime was completely dependent on foreign powers, Russia and Iran, that when they were weakened, therefore the regime vanished.
Ramah Kudaimi:
Yeah, it's wonderful to be in convo with both of you and really happy, Joseph, you got to go to Syria. I'm still trying to figure out when to go myself. But yeah, that beautiful joy that people had, that continues to be had is something just so awe-inspiring. And just the shift of even how I'm able to have conversations with my family there. Immediately, the shift happened. And it was very shocking that people are immediately like, ""Yeah, let's openly talk about everything now,"" after decades of really being afraid to say much about anything over WhatsApp or other way we have been staying in contact. So that stuff really was deep in so many people across the country, and we saw that fear break. We saw that fear break early on in the revolution. And then what we've been seeing I think these last two months is just that continuous joy and bringing us back to those early days of the revolution when people were just happy to be out in the street making demands.
And I think some of what Joseph talked about in terms of like, oh yeah, people are just having political conversations, that doesn't seem like a big deal, but it is really a big deal in Syria. And I think that's something I would want to remind people. When we're talking about authoritarianism, we're really talking about a brutal, violent dictatorship that there was no opposition whatsoever, not like in other countries in the region where there was a controlled opposition. Here that wasn't even accepted that there was a controlled opposition. It was just complete fealty to the regime, and specifically to the Assad family themselves.
I think that's another thing we need to remind ourselves, of what the regime was like. It was just really out for themselves for decades. The disappearances and the torture that we saw during the last almost 15 years of revolution were happening decades beforehand. All those pictures and videos of people being released from the prisons, it wasn't only people who were released just from the start of the revolution, we're talking about people who spent decades of their lives there. So that context is also important to understand why there is so much optimism and joy in this moment, even though we don't know what's going to necessarily happen next.
Ashley Smith:
Right. I think one thing we've got to do is start with the most recent wave of revolt, because you both have just talked about that this has been a decades-long struggle for the liberation of the Syrian people from this regime. But the most recent wave of revolt really began back in 2011 as part of the so-called Arab Spring uprisings. What precipitated the uprising in 2011 in Syria? Who participated in it? How was it organized? What were people demanding?
Ramah Kudaimi:
So much has happened since the end of 2010, 2011 that people kind of forget what sparked all of this. And we get bogged down into like, well, the US versus Russia, Saudi versus Iran, all the geopolitics. And what happened was this moment in time where people across the region were inspired to make a simple demand, that people want the fall of the regime. And that demand we saw go from Tunisia to Egypt to Libya to Bahrain to Yemen to Syria and beyond, to Iraq, there were protests early on, et cetera. And so I think that's such an important context that we need to really delve into. And how important that moment was, particularly because it came almost a decade after the start of the global war on terror and the US invasions and occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq. And kind of really a moment in time that was very dark for the region.
We were having the Palestinian Second Intifada at the time as well. And so this was a moment where people were like, ""No, actually we can make our own demands of these regions. We aren't just being played by this geopolitical power versus this other one and whatever regime is wanting to do."" And so particularly in Syria, it started the famous protests of youth in Daraa, who saw what was happening across the region and decided to paint these freedom slogans on the walls of their city. And they were immediately arrested and tortured. The army person who was in charge of their torture actually just recently got captured, thankfully. So we can talk more about the need for accountability. But their torture then sparked more protests by folks in Daraa and were eventually met with even tanks and further violence, which then brought out protests against cities across the country. And there's how this revolution sparked.
So there's just that sparking of it. And obviously there's things like the economic situation was not that good at the time. There was a drought happening, there was high unemployment. The Bashar al-Assad had really opened up the country in terms of neoliberal policies, which meant slashing of subsidies and rising expenses. And none of that was necessarily new. But that with the moment of protests happening across the region with, again, if we think by February, March, 2011 when things started picking up in Syria, by that time Ben Ali had already fled in Tunisia, Mubarak had stepped down in Egypt. So that was two huge processes that brought down regimes that had been in power for decades. Of course people are going to then be like, ""Why can't this happen to us too?""
Joseph Daher:
I think what Ramah explained is key. And the images also of seeing people protest in Tunis and especially in Tahrir Square. I think the fall of Mubarak was a key turning point. Without forgetting obviously what happened in Bahrain, Yemen and Libya. And I think the roots, while every country has its own specificities, has to be found in obviously the absence of democracy, but also the particular, if you want, capitalist dynamics in the region where you have for the past decades, a form of blocked economic development focused on sectors of economy with short-term profits, such as luxurious real estate, financial services, trade. While productive sectors of the economy, such as agriculture and manufacturing industry, were very much diminished or undermined through the neoliberal policies. And obviously this increased also as well the level of corruption.
So contrary to what a lot of academics and the US kind of discourse, more neoliberalism or economic liberalism did not bring democracy out [inaudible 00:15:20]. It brought quite the opposite, a form of upgrading authoritarianism, what we witnessed throughout the uprising. So yes, there were specificities in each country, but again, I think they all had similar kind of characteristics when it came to absence of democracy, absence of social justice, blocked economic development, and a willingness of the popular classes to basically participate in the future of the country, to decide their own future.
Now, when it came to the Syrian uprising, what was interesting was the form of organization. Very rapidly, we had local coordination committees at the level of neighborhoods, cities, region, starting to organize protests, forms of civilian resistance. But the local coordination committees had democratic aspirations, I would even say some socioeconomic aspirations as well, talking about the issue of social justice inequalities. Because if you look at the geography of the uprising in Syria, it's very much the poor neighborhoods of the big cities, rural areas, midtowns that suffered mostly from the neoliberal policies, the austerity measures that Ramah mentioned.
And afterwards, as the uprising continued, also the regime withdrew from certain areas. And this is important to say that we had forms of double power, meaning that you had a key challenge to the center of power and people self-organizing through local councils. And obviously we shouldn't romanticize all experiences. Some of them were not completely democratic, the role of armed opposition forces was also problematic. But there were attempts in large areas of Syria to self-organize, to manage their own life. And afterwards, unfortunately, we had militarization that was imposed on the Syrian population. There were harsh debates among Syrian protest movement on the issue of militarization. We forget now, but there were harsh debates was not easy solutions. And very often at the beginning it was civilians taking up arms to defend their own neighborhoods. And this is how the Free Syrian Army developed afterwards. Unfortunately, the level of violence was so heavy, so high on the protesters. Also the level of foreign intervention increased massively.
So we had a popular uprising that turned into with foreign interventions from all sides. First of all, on the side of the regime, Hezbollah of Lebanon, Iran, very early on, even mid-end of 2011, and afterwards, Russia, 2015. On the other side, the so-called Friends of Syria, such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Qatar played also a very reactionary role by supporting the most, I think, reactionary sectors of the Syrian opposition. While most of these actors in the first six months of the uprising were trying to reach a deal with the Syrian regime at the time, we forget this, and they were quite big economic investors in Syria prior to 2011, for all of them were close allies. We forget that Erdogan and Bashar al-Assad used to spend their vacations together prior to 2011.
So all this made that until recently, the roots, if you want, of the organization of the Syrian popular uprising suffered massively. First of all, because of the repression, the deadly repression of Syrian regime, its attempts to sectarianize from the beginning, eliminate every kind of democratic opposition and the rise of reactionary Islamic fundamentalist forces, the rise of foreign interventions, and militarization. And there were only few pockets I would see a continuous, I would say, roots of the popular uprising. But the key dominating aspect, unfortunately, since 2015 was the military aspect, in which it's very hard to democratic and progressive to express and organize.
Ashley Smith:
So let's talk now about how Assad was able to withstand this revolutionary uprising. What enabled the regime to survive one of the most mass popular uprisings of any of them that happened in the Middle East back in 2011 with the most democratic self-organization? What kind of regional and international powers intervened to help save the regime? And what was the impact of the counterrevolution on the country? Maybe we can start with you, Ramah on this.
Ramah Kudaimi:
Yeah, it's interesting because I think for people who are into conspiracy theories, a lot of times it's like, ""Well, this was a conspiracy against the Assad regime."" And the reality is I think many people will tell you no, actually the global conspiracy was against the revolution itself. So we have the obvious actors that came in to support the Assad regime, which Joseph talked about in terms of Iran, Hezbollah, Russia. And we have to understand too, it wasn't just the official armies of these folks, but Iran, for example, backed a lot of militias, whether it's militias from Iraq or militias of people that they sent from refugee camps like Afghan, Pakistanis, refugees in Iran that they would just send to fight on their behalf in Syria, which is absolutely ridiculous that they would be able to get away with this.
And the fact that they did it with such ruthlessness. We're talking the bombing of hospitals was just a normal thing. Something we obviously spent the last year watching Israel do in Gaza, Assad normalized it to such an extent across Syria. The use of chemical weapons, the torture, the imprisonment, the siege, all tactics to destroy the uprising and all, again, supported by various international powers. And even, frankly, by the so-called Friends of Syria at one point and another where it was just like there could have been more potentially ways to hold Assad back that different regimes refused to do, did not want to do.Because at the end it became, I think, very clear, especially by 2013, 2014, that the preservation of the regime was much more important than the people actually succeeding in their revolution.
And then we saw that, as Joseph was talking about, as folks took up more arms and it became more of an armed resistance against the regime, I mean sometimes that's just going to be the reality of what's going to happen when you have activists who were imprisoned, killed, or forced to flee, when you had geopolitics becoming the dominant discourse. So that was what became the issue in Syria versus, again, what do the everyday people want? And that's such an important part of the conversation we need to have in terms of how we move forward and the future of Syria is to always remember who actually had the Syrian people's future and their goals in mind. It was no one other than the Syrian people. It was obviously not those who came in support of the Assad regime. It was not the United States who was supposedly against the regime. It was not any of the various Friends of Syria that came together. It was not the United Nations and other international bodies. Let's be very clear. So I think that's a very important part of the conversation as we talk now and then in the future.
Joseph Daher:
Well, I totally agree with Ramah. I just add very few things. As I mentioned before, in the summer of 2012, half of Syria was outside the control of the regime. This is where you had extension increase in the assistance given by Iran, Hezbollah and the militia supported by Iran. In 2015, Russia intervened. And it was from this period they were able to reconquer territories. First of all, Eastern Aleppo in 2016, after Damascus countryside, Daraa. But even with this, it wasn't enough. And militarily, the regime needed Iran and Russia, but also politically and economically. And this is how they accumulated a huge debt, especially to Iran, the 30, 50 billions. I think this is something that should be taken more by, especially the authorities, but the Syrian Democrats, is that we have an odious debt, so we don't need to pay it to the Iranians.
And the fact that this debt was made consciously against the interest of the Syrian people and Iran was participating in the massacres and keeping this regime in place. Plus, and it's important also, as Ramah was saying, that everyone was against the fall of this regime, basically. There was a normalization that was started from 2018. The US and Russia were kind of having deal, how do they share Syria? It was clear that Israel from the beginning and for the past decades saw as a threat the fall of this regime. And the day after the fall of this regime, the best proof of this is that they bombed massively Syrian state capacities, armed capacities and extended the occupation of Syria the day after the fall of the guardian of the border with Israel.
So we had a normalization period, et cetera. And the fall of the regime came from an initiative from an armed group, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham. But even there was a green light given by Turkey. Turkey also entered the normalization process with the Syrian regime. So none of them wanting it. But because this regime was so weak and dependent on foreign actors, Iran and Russia most especially, and when they were weakened, again as I said, because it had no popular support, it vanished. So here we see really the key issues of foreign actors within the Syrian revolution process. And throughout the past five years, I would say, whether the kind of so-called Friends of Syria or Russia and Iran on the side really wanted to impose a form of authoritarian stability in the region, which included Assad.
Ashley Smith:
So let's talk a little bit about how the US got involved, because both of you just touched on this. And it seems to me that the real turning point for significant intervention was after the rise of ISIS, which took over whole sections of Syria and Iraq. And the US then started intervening quite intensively. So what were its aims in doing so? What was the US really up to in Syria?
Joseph Daher:
Well, and again, I think it's important, especially now that it's been more than a decade, and also speaking with this in Syria with people that are a generation of 20 years old and asking them how they joined the revolution, et cetera. And I think we have to have the kind of similar kind of discussion outside, how the Arab uprisings or the uprisings in the region started and it wasn't a conspiracy or et cetera. And in the case of Syria, again looking at the role of the US, I will always remember Hillary Clinton from I think the first few weeks of the uprising saying, ""You know, Bashar Assad is a reformist, he's not like his father."" It was two or three years before Obama reopened the embassy in Damascus. There was willingness to cooperate. And the Syrian regime of Assad, father and son, had a long history of cooperation with US imperialism. I think it's important to remind everyone.
And it was clear from the beginning, they said, ""We will not have any Libyan scenario in Syria."" They were not interested in any kind of destruction of the Syrian regime. Rather they were seeking maybe to replace the head with another head that would be more submissive to their own political interests. But because of the nature of the Syrian regime, this was very difficult to do, the patrimonial nature, concentration of centers of power. But they definitely didn't want the uprising to see a full complete of the acien regime, they were more in a controlled transition. This was the main aim of the US. And with the rise of ISIS, this challenged also the interests in the region and especially in Iraq. Iraqi Kurdistan, with the leadership of Barazan is a key ally. And they saw ISIS as creating, when it established its so-called Islamic Emirate from Mosul to Raqqa as a threat to the regional order.
And this is when they intervened. They did not intervene in a manner to serve the interest of the Syrian population, but to serve their own political interests. And therefore there was never any kind of real intervention against the Syrian regime. There was one offensive made by Trump in the first presidency following the massacre, the chemical massacre of Khan Shaykhun, the city up north. But even then, the attack they did was really symbolic and they had actually told the Syrian and Russian that they would attack this particular military basements areas. So it was very clear for the US they always wanted a very clear control transition that does not create more chaos to the region, especially to Israel, Jordan, which is a key ally of the US as well. So here, I believe the main role of the US, it was never to challenge actually the Syrian regime.
Ramah Kudaimi:
The only other thing I'd add is just the context of, again, this continuing global war on terror and the excuse that that has given various presidents since 2001 to go in and go after, quote, unquote, ""the terrorists."" So I think obviously, you know, Obama declared that the war on terror was over in 2013. That obviously was not true because a year later he's going into Iraq and Syria against ISIS. Biden claimed, you know, ""I withdrew the troops from Afghanistan in 2021."" That hasn't stopped necessarily various drone strikes, especially in parts of Africa particularly. And then, obviously, what we've seen again with Israel and Gaza since October 7th, 2023.
And I think that's just part of the conversation as well in terms of like when the US and their allies truly intervened, it was to, again, fight who they were considering as terrorists. And it was to ensure these... We agree these are reactionary forces were destroyed. But it also happened around a time where the Assad regime was being very weakened. And what did that mean in terms of, in this moment of time where you chose to intervene was not against Assad but against ISIS.
Ashley Smith:
Right. So let's turn a little bit to the questions about the later stages in the run-up to the toppling of the regime because one of the key powers in the region that started to intervene, that we really haven't talked that much about, is Turkey. And Turkey played an increasing role, largely in opposition to the rise of a Kurdish revolutionary process within Syria, including establishing a regional autonomous area, Rojava. So why did Turkey increasingly intervene and become a player in Syria despite the deals, that Joseph talked about, the Erdogan regime making with Assad?
Joseph Daher:
Again, it's important to remind everyone that Erdogan and Bashar Assad were great foes, there was commercial free trade agreement between both countries that now they want to also revive that would be catastrophic in economic terms for Syrian national production, especially manufacturing industry and agriculture. So in the first six months of the uprising, Turkey pushed for a deal between the Syrian regime and the Muslim Brotherhood that was refused, and they cut relations completely. And this is where Turkish state started supporting sectors of the opposition, especially in the beginning, Muslim Brotherhood welcoming a lot of Syrians. And throughout the years, as the Syrian regime with the help of its foreign allies, Turkey saw it was unable, basically, at this period, to overthrow the regime, turned more and more to concentrate on trying to put an end to what it perceives as a continuation of its national threat or national security threat, the Kurdish issue. And especially the fallout of the peace negotiation.
So therefore, from there on, this concentrated more and more on the northeast, which is controlled by the autonomous administration of the Northeast, which is dominated by the PYD, a sister organization of PKK. So Turkey saw it as a continuation of its basically national security threat around the Kurdish issue. And this is how we understand the increasing intervention of Turkey in Syria. Also, it was to preserve its influence through the support of what is called its proxy, Syrian National Army, which is composed of tens of thousands of soldiers paid by Turkey, that serve their interests. And also lastly, there was the issue of the Syrian refugees that became an internal factor of instability for the AKP and rising racism against Syrian refugees. So they wanted to also to push them back to Syria. So I think these are the key, until recently, until the fall of the regime.
Ramah Kudaimi:
Turkey, like every other regional player, has its interests and those interests changed throughout the last 10, 12 years. And I think that's an important, again, part of the conversation of what it means for those of us outside of the region, what solidarity looks like to be thinking about these things. It's not just always a clearly like, ""Here's the formula of what it means to be a leftist."" Because I think that's what a lot of times we're looking for, instead of being like, ""Things are going to shift very dramatically,"" we have seen, and we need to be always on top of these shifts and understand when there are moments that like, yeah, there came a time when Turkey was very supportive of the revolution and was providing a lot to refugees, what does that mean? And then they flip obviously because they have their own concerns in relationship to their power and the Kurdish question, as Joseph was talking about. And now this flip-flop back of just like, ""Oh, can we... Now the people we like are in power.""
Ashley Smith:
So if you think about where we stand over the last year, before the last year, before the Israeli genocidal war, Assad is in power, he's normalizing relations with all these regional powers, but the country is not entirely controlled by Assad. There's the Kurdish region, autonomous region, there's sections of the country controlled by HTS, and the regime only has a narrow base. So what changed in the region and who are the forces that toppled the regime?
Joseph Daher:
First of all, it's important to remember that the Assad regime had couple of changes to seek or to be able to guarantee in a way the survival of its regime by entering a form of transitional phase that was very symbolic because before its fall, the resolution 2254, UN resolution was seen by the regime in Russia, basically the demands were being constantly undermined since 2012 as the regime was normalizing. But the regime never sought, first of all, to restructure its own institutions, to seek even to guarantee some of the interests of actors they were normalizing with. This is one thing also, this is, and despite the fact that Russia and Iran were saying to some extent, not harshly, to the Syrian regime, try to give a bit to guarantee a bit.
But more importantly, first of all you have the weakening of Russia following its imperialist war against Ukraine. It was not able to be able again to intervene as it was before. Iran and Hezbollah were definitely weakened by the sequence of events that followed the beginning of the genocide in Gaza. Israel was more and more, and with the total support of the US, because this genocide has been ongoing mainly because of US support and obviously European, but mainly US, especially military economically. So it weakened Hezbollah massively in the war of Lebanon and Iran in Syria. And you had even other areas outside the control of the region such as Suwayda and partially Daraa in the south. And these two actors actually, military actors from these regions when HTS, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, and again no one was seeing that they were top of the regime.
First of all, I think even them, their main objective was to have better position in future negotiation by taking the countryside of Aleppo, possibly Aleppo, but not the whole. But when they were continuing the attack, it was actually armed groups from the south that entered first Damascus. And you had also part of a popular dynamics protest that is important to remember. First, and after let Ramah, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, we have to acknowledge that it went through major ideological political evolution from starting as a branch of Daesh in 2012, Jabhat al-Nusra, then falling out with Daesh, joining Al-Qaeda, falling out with Al-Qaeda. And basically because of the material reality they're living in, they had to, in the northwest, basically rule an area.
So they're not anymore a transnational jihadist organization. They're very pragmatist and they've been very pragmatist for a while. It's not new. Does that mean they're a democratic organization? No, far from it. They want to consolidate now their power and authoritarian, neoliberal, et cetera. We can come back to this later. The Syrian National Army, as I said, is acting as a main proxy of Turkey really. And this is a key asset for Turkey. And Turkey today is the most important regional actor within Syria.
Ramah Kudaimi:
I think I'll also say that I think we can't forget that even though it was under this banner of HTS, this is offensive started, right after, you know, the end of November through December 8th when Assad fled. We have to remember Idlib as a region housed Syrians from across the country. Idlib was where everyone would escape to when, you know, there was a deal made, when Assad would lay siege on an area, and then the UN would intervene. And in order to end the siege, the deal would be that these folks would hop on what became known, these green buses that everyone saw these images of, and then take the fighters and their families to Idlib.
And I think that's an important part of the conversation of just like a lot of these fighters that were part of this offensive were fighters who were returning to their homes, reuniting with their families. And so when they went to Halab, when they went to Hama, when they went to Homs, it was people returning to their homes. And I say that because I think that is a very different narrative than like, ""Oh these HTS reactionaries brought down this, quote, unquote, 'secular regime,'"" which I think is something that certain parts of the internet is trying to push, this narrative, which is just not true. And I think it's important to have these facts in place as we talk about what the future of Syria is and also to like really inspire us when we talk about... So many struggles across the globe are about returning to the homeland. And we're witnessing an opening now of people returning to their homelands.
Ashley Smith:
Yeah, I think that really captures the dual dynamic of the toppling of the regime, that it had this very mass popular element to it of people within the country feeling liberated and HTS trying to consolidate its rule. So I want to ask about now the post-revolutionary situation and the kind of trajectory of things in Syria. So what is HTS trying to do in consolidating its transitional government? And how are the popular forces, the popular classes responding to that? And how does this connect to the original goals of the revolution in 2011?
Ramah Kudaimi:
Yeah, it seems like every day something new comes up, which is exciting, it is really exciting and it's like, ""Oh wow, things are just not set in stone?"" I think people continue to be optimistic. I know I actually surprise myself when I'm like, ""Oh this is interesting."" That pragmatism that Joseph was talking about is really coming through a lot in ways that at times I found unexpected. And my hopes of hopes that that continues. Even though we know, again, it's not like some leftist socialist project is being born in Syria at this moment in time. Let's be real. That is not what is being born at this moment. But that does not also mean that the opening isn't there for the future of that.
And I think that's the biggest thing to me to keep in mind is like these openings are so important because, again, under these decades long under the Assad regime, those openings were not absolutely there. So even if the folks who are in power now, these folks who you know are former HTS fighters who are reactionary in many of their politics, et cetera, that is not necessarily the ideal where actor that the majority of Syrians would be like, ""Yes, this is who we want to take over."" And yet under what we've been seeing these last two months is there continues to be openings for these conversations and these discussions and people being out and having these things very publicly, again, back to the early days of the revolution, these demands being made.
I do think there's like three things that I think really are important for us to continue to push on for those original goals of the revolution. One, how do we get accountability for all the war crimes? So obviously first and foremost, Assad and his cronies. And we're seeing some people have been getting arrested. I think there was an official demand made of Russia to hand over Assad recently. So what does that mean? But the reality is when you have 10, 12 years of war, all kinds of actors have committed war crimes, whether it is HTS, whether it is SDF, like so many of these rebel groups. And what does accountability mean? Not accountability like everyone needs to be punished, but what is the process in order to get us to a point when we can actually rebuild this country, recognizing all the different pain and suffering all sectors of society went to.
I think the other one, I think there's been a lot of demands and protests by the families of the disappeared. And I think that's one thing that actually has disappointed a lot of people is that, well, Sharaa now officially being the president of Syria has yet, to my understanding, to meet any of the families of the disappeared. And that's been something that I think across the board has been a disappointment by many folks. And then I think there is this question of there's a terrible economic situation in place and also the political situation. And I think there's like this question of like what do you tackle first? Do you go all in to try to fix the economy because that's what people need to survive? But does that then mean that the political situation of like the basics of freedom of assembly and freedom of speech and how we can get subsumed into this like economic solution? And I think those are the kind of discussions that need to continue. And hopefully that there continues to be space for that as we see various people take their positions in power now.
Joseph Daher:
Yeah, I think I will start where Ramah finished. The issue of the space to organize. And again, I think this is a principle for leftists. We see what the country, society, what is the space to organize for workers for popular classes? And it's undeniable that since the fall of the regime, this space has increased massively. And this is, again, a victory for anyone thinking in gaining interest for the popular classes, working classes. Moreover, Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham is still unable, because of the lack of human capacities and military capacities, to completely and fully dominate the country, which is a chance again for the Syrian popular classes.
Does that mean it transformed automatically in the future democratic social society? No, it's a race now. It's basically a race between the ability of the Syrian popular classes, working classes to organize democratically, socially, et cetera. And on the other side, a clear, I think, willingness that has been proven for me since day one nearly or the day after the fall of the regime, that HTS is seeking to consolidate its power. The first government, transitional government they established was from one color, all the same ministers from Idlib establishment of a new army only with their members. Now they want to integrate people from the Syrian National Army. And some of them are true criminals, Abu Amsha, and others that are known assassins, establishment of new security services by the right hand of Julani, Ahmad al-Sharaa, designation in various professional associations and trade unions of new leadership. For example, the Lawyers Association and the members opposed it and demanded free elections.
So there's a clear attempt, and also on other levels they have no legitimacy for the moment to decide on the future of the economic trajectory of the country. They already made various statements regarding this. And a clear neoliberal path, privatization of state assets, ports, airports, transport networks, et cetera. And wanting to put an end to various forms of subsidies, bread obviously, electricity, et cetera. Now I think what Ramah was saying is one of the key issues I will just add regarding transitional justice, it would be key also to struggle against sectarian tensions, I believe so, without transitional justice it will be very hard, as well as ethnic divisions within the country. And we've seen in the past few days and weeks militia campaigns by HTS in rural areas of Homs that have killed dozens of people. We're seeing rising tension. Full transitional justice I think can be also tackled, but I think democratic and social rights will have to go together.
I'm very afraid that if there's no economic improvement, because again, 90% of the population live under the poverty line, massive destructions. For a large section of the Syrians, obviously they're happy because the regime is stopped, but their socioeconomic situation has not changed. So they still have to deal on a daily basis how they're going to be able to live. And if we're not able to improve their condition, they will not. It's not because they're unwilling, but they will not be able to participate to democratic debates or issues of citizenship, et cetera. And there's a fear that we transform this issue in elitist discussions, issues of [inaudible 00:46:28] if we're not able to bring them with socioeconomic issues. And here, I believe the role of trade unions, professional associations should be key, asking for free elections within it, starting to be active on its workplace, et cetera. So again, there are a lot of challenges, but as I started, I think, the discussion, the ability to think about these challenges, to live them is already a victory.
Ashley Smith:
So I want to end with one final question, which is really the theme of the entire podcast that we're doing, which is called Solidarity Without Exception, with all democratic uprisings throughout the world. And one of the things that's striking in a discussion about Syria is how much of the progressive left didn't extend solidarity to the Syrian revolution, but did extend solidarity to the Palestinian liberation struggle. And really the question is why did that happen? And how should we think about solidarity globally, with the Ukrainian struggle for self-determination, with the Syrian struggle for the transformation of their society, with the struggle for Palestinian liberation and their relationship between one and another?
Ramah Kudaimi:
Yeah, I think I'll start with saying that it also wasn't necessarily a given that the left would be so in support of Palestinian liberation. I think that took decades of struggle as well. I think we all have been part of that struggle, and I think that's just, unfortunately, being a leftist doesn't mean that automatically you have the right politics. This is struggle that we're having and organizing and needing to do. The importance of political education and organizing is important. And yes, of course it makes sense why particularly in the West leftists would be very clear about their solidarity with the Palestinian people since it is the Western countries, particularly the United States, arming the genocide for decades now.
But I think what continues to be so infuriating is why that somehow is seen as requiring then Western leftists to, say, shill for Putin or shill for the Assad regime when they were still in power. And also having to realize that imperialism, Islamophobia, the war on terror, these are not just Western projects at this point. These are projects of China, these are projects of Russia, these are projects of the regional powers across the globe. And it's so important that we, again, as I was saying earlier, it's not just like, ""Here are the three leftist positions,"" no, we have principles as leftists and then we understand how we look at a situation based on our principles and our values and then decide this is what it means to be in solidarity with the oppressed people.
And I think we've seen, similar to how liberals spent 2024 telling us we have to throw Palestinians under the bus in order to ensure that the greater fight against the right wing prevails, i.e. we have to support the Democrats in order for Trump to be defeated, I think leftists have had that positions towards Syrians for years now in terms of the greater fight is anti-imperialist fight. Assad somehow falls in that and so that is why the Syrian people need to just be sacrificed. And what we've learned is allowing genocide and massive war crimes to continue actually just leads to fascism and right-wing politics, whether it's in Syria or US support for Israel.
And I think we have to really push ourselves as leftists this idea that just whataboutism is not a politic. Calling out liberal hypocrisy is not politics. We are losing as leftists, to be very real. And seeing, like it hasn't even been two weeks of Trump, and I'm like, ""We are in trouble."" And one of the reasons we are in trouble is because a large part, again, of the left has just failed at understanding what our project should be and putting out a vision of what our project is meant that is not just like in of itself a hypocritical vision, just like what liberals have done with conservatives and the right wing. I think in this moment I think there's a lot that we can, again, be inspired by the Syrian people. And for us it's like, ""What can we do at this moment?"" We still have an opportunity to change the way we interact with the Syrian revolution. And so things like demanding the lifting of sanctions is going to be very important.
So how are we pushing that the sanctions gets lifted? And how are we doing more grassroots support and donating as the grassroots left across the globe so that these institutions in Syria who are trying to rebuild are not only dependent on the neoliberal capitalist world system that we are, obviously. And then the misinformation and the disinformation, the propaganda we need to continue to watch for it and continue to trust the people of Syria. We've seen Syrians over and over again uprise when they need it, whether it's from the regime. Syrians who were living under HTS in Idlib had no problem going out and making demands of HTS.
So I think that's a reality we can't just succumb to of just like, ""Well, now this reactionary force is in power, then that's it, it's all over."" No. Trust the people. And again, because for those of us in the US, the arms embargo demand around Israel continues to be top, not only obviously for Palestinian liberation, but we saw what Israel did immediately after the fall of the regime, go in, take more land, destroy all the planes and all these things that they somehow did not do while Assad was in power. And now all of a sudden take out all the military assets of the state. So I think that continues to be another important demand, and why we cannot separate our solidarity with Palestine from the solidarity of everyone else in the region.
Joseph Daher:
Yeah, it's great, Ramah, because I always want to start where she finishes. It's amazing. No, regarding the direct demand based Ramah in the US, you in the US, me in Europe is we can see direct links between the solidarity campaigns with Palestine and Syria. First of all, oppose Western imperialism and especially regarding sanctions. I was opposed against the general sectoral sanctions on Syria prior to the fall of the regime, based on the fact that these sanctions were hitting massively the same population and impoverishing them partially. And I'm opposed also today because it's definitely a political card used by Western imperialists, especially the US, to pressure any kind of government. Today it's HTS, hopefully tomorrow it's not anymore. Maybe a bit afterwards. But it's a card of pressure. And this is unacceptable. Goes against the interest of Syrian population.
Just as the genocide was allowed and permitted and supported by Western imperialism, just as the war in Lebanon and expansion, occupation and destruction of Syrian statement and military capacities by Israel. So all of this, we can see the common demands, I mean, regarding Israel as genocide, continuous occupation, et cetera. And I think more broadly, our work is also because the significance of campism is also the inability to project a political alternative built on socialism from below. The ability of the people to change radically a political situation, a political framework from mass participation from below.
This idea came back at the beginning of the uprisings in the MENA region after Tunis, Egypt. It was lost partially because of the counter revolutions. And I think it's also something that throughout the world, this ability to change from below a political framework has been lost partially. And we have to rebuild this issue of socialism from below, internationalism that runs against a view by campism, that because change from below is not possible, we will basically put our politics in geopolitical dynamics, and we hope that the enemy of my enemy is partially kind of my friend. So basically the Russia, China as opposed to the US, therefore maybe we could find an opportunity to improve our own situation, regardless of the fact that these regimes are authoritarian, neoliberal, patriarchal, et cetera.
And it's putting also false hopes in these kinds of... It's wrong hopes, wrong strategy, completely, to believe that these regimes that have very good relation, by the way, with Israel, that they not challenge the capitalist system, they just want a bigger part in it. And similarly with the so-called axis of resistance, how can we trust regimes or political parties that oppose their own popular classes, that repress them, that participate in a system of oppression? So again, I think the key issue is bringing back this issue of socialism from below, internationalism and that basically our destinies are connected. The liberation of Palestine is connected to the liberation of the popular classes of the Middle East and North Africa, and of the support, the international support, internationalist support of leftist popular classes against the complicity of their own state in a genocide and an apartheid state. And this is what we have to work with, to believe once again that our destinies are linked regardless of the borders and knowing the different situation. But really, it's through internationalism, socialism from below that we believe that we can liberate Palestine and the further region internationally.
Ashley Smith:
Thanks to both Joseph and Ramah for that eye-opening discussion of Syria's revolutionary process. Clearly a new day has dawned in Syria, one that offers hope for a truly democratic transition, but also challenges posed by Islamic fundamentalists in power as well as regional and imperialist powers. Stay tuned for our next episode on Solidarity Without Exception, hosted by Blanca Missé, where she will discuss Puerto Rico's ongoing struggle for national self-determination and its class struggle against the island's elite, with state senator and activist, Rafael Bernabe.

China’s CGTN news said that the Marine Security Belt 2025 exercises began near the Iranian port of Chabahar on Tuesday and were aimed at strengthening “cooperation among the naval forces of the participating countries”.

The naval drills will involve “striking maritime targets, damage control, and joint search and rescue operations”, according to CGTN.

“Over the course of two days, the ships’ crews conducted daytime and nighttime fire from large-calibre machine guns and small arms at targets simulating unmanned boats and unmanned aerial vehicles of a mock enemy,” Russia’s Interfax news agency reported, citing a statement from the Russian Ministry of Defence.

Iran’s Press TV said naval groups from Azerbaijan, South Africa, Oman, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Qatar, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Sri Lanka were also observing the drills.

Although China and Russia do not typically patrol waters in the Middle East, the region’s waterways have become increasingly militarised in recent years.

The Chinese, Iranian, and Russian navies kicked off a joint exercise near the Iranian port of Chabahar.

In late 2023, Yemen’s Houthis began attacking ships linked to Israel in the Red Sea, in what they say is an act of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

The Houthis paused their attacks after a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel began in January but have threatened to resume military operations if Israel does not lift its renewed siege of Gaza, in which it has been blocking food, medicine and other essential supplies from entering the war-torn territory for 10 days.

The United States and other Western countries have also increased their presence in the Red Sea, with a 10-nation force announced in December 2023 to counter Houthi attacks. The US Navy also has a fleet based in Bahrain.

Iran nuclear programme

This year’s naval drills come as US President Donald Trump said he had sent a letter to the Iranian leadership seeking to revive talks on a nuclear deal, years after Trump withdrew the US from a previous deal during his first term in office.

“There are two ways Iran can be handled: militarily, or you make a deal,” Trump told Fox Business last week.

Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has accused Washington of seeking to impose even greater restrictions on Iran than in previous negotiations.

“Some bully governments insist on negotiations,” he said, according to state media. “But their negotiations are not aimed at solving issues, but to dominate and impose their own expectations.”

“For them, negotiation is a means to introduce new demands. The issue is not just about nuclear matters, they raise new expectations that Iran will certainly not accept,” Khamenei said.

Trump unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions on Tehran.

Despite complying with the nuclear agreement for more than a year after the US withdrawal, Iran gradually reduced its commitments, citing the failure of the deal’s remaining signatories to protect its interests.

Unlike Israel, which is thought to have some 90 nuclear warheads, Iran is not thought to have developed any of its own nuclear weapons.",,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/12/iran-russia-china-conduct-joint-naval-drills-in-gulf-of-oman?traffic_source=rss,,,qatar,,news,,,,,,7,9,,3,,,aljazeera.com,,,,,,,,positive,0.9881920218467712
News,qa,post,295642302,2025-03-01,"Qatar Museums CEO to QNA: Committed to Projects that Strengthen Qatar s Role as a Global Cultural Leader Doha, March 01 (QNA) - CEO of Qatar Museums (QM), Mohammed Saad Al Rumaihi, affirmed that Qatar Museums continues to play a significant role in promoting sustainability, openness to the world, and supporting creativity.

Speaking to Qatar News Agency (QNA), Al Rumaihi stated that Qatar Museums aims to expand its global partnerships and present various cultural projects to enhance Qatar's position as a leading cultural hub on the global stage.

He revealed the key projects Qatar Museums plans to launch during the spring of 2025, including the third edition of Qatar Photo Festival ""Tasweer"".

This biennial festival features exhibitions, awards, presentations, and workshops, aiming to empower the diverse practices of photographers and photography communities in Qatar and the MENA region.

He stated that this year's theme focuses on the concept of belonging through five exhibitions held in museums, galleries, and outdoor venues in Doha, adding that the Fire Station, Artist in Residence, will host the festival's main exhibition on the theme of sea meditation as a discovering of true self, curated by Tasweer’s artistic director Meriem Berrada, highlighting three generations of Arab artists whose works provoke public thought on their place in the world and their role in society.

Al Rumaihi also mentioned that this season will feature the exhibition ""Latinoamericano: Modern and Contemporary Art"" from the collections of the Latin American Art Museum in Buenos Aires (MALBA) and Eduardo F. Costantini.

This landmark exhibition will be the first major showcase of Latin American art in the MENA region. And another exhibition featuring works by Qatari artists from Abdullah bin Ali bin Saud Al Thani collection, will be held at Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art.

Among the significant exhibitions organized by Qatar Museums is ""Wafa Al Hamad: Geography of Imagination,"" the first solo exhibition of the late Qatari artist, featuring works from the museum's permanent collection.

Other notable events include the ""Al-Raqeem Calligraphy Competition, ""A Seat at the Table: Food Culture in the Islamic World"" at the Museum of Islamic Art, and ""A Journey in Design with Marcello Gandini between Italy and Qatar,"" presented by the Qatar Auto Museum.

Al Rumaihi emphasized that Qatar Museums has made significant strides in integrating sustainability across all its operations, focusing on eco-friendly practices in building design and construction and daily activities.

The institution has achieved notable milestones, including obtaining prestigious international certifications from organizations such as LEED and GSAS, as well as other significant awards.

Qatar Museums has also revolutionized waste management practices through community engagement initiatives.

He mentioned that Qatar Museums is working to achieve carbon neutrality certification for the Fire Station: Artist in Residence, having already received carbon neutrality certification for the Museum of Islamic Art in 2022.

This unprecedented achievement reinforces its position as a leading cultural institution in the MENA region.

The certification was granted by CSR-A, a renowned UK-based organization that honors institutions integrating social, environmental, and ethical considerations into their practices.

Al Rumaihi stressed that Qatar Museums will continue striving towards creating a more sustainable and responsible future, with the awards, particularly for the National Museum of Qatar, highlighting their ongoing efforts towards sustainability and environmental preservation, adding that success means making a positive impact on the world around us, reflecting the core values and mission of our institution. 

CEO Mohammed Saad Al Rumaihi highlighted Qatar Museums’ key partnerships with counterpart institutions around the world over the past year, and their most significant outcomes in enhancing Qatar Museums’ global image.

He explained that Qatar Museums signed a historic cooperation agreement with the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC), affiliated with the Aga Khan Development Network, aim at advancing efforts in heritage preservation, art education, vocational training, and urban renewal initiatives.

Additionally, it concluded a cooperation agreement with the global Alwaleed Philanthropies Foundation to support projects around the world.

Al Rumaihi noted that these agreements represent a joint commitment to enhance various aspects of the creative economy and supporting local creators and craftsmen.

Qatar Museums has also signed several memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with prestigious museums and institutions around the world, aimed at fostering cooperation and offering distinctive experiences for visitors.

These include an MoU with the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority on the occasion of the first Hong Kong International Cultural Summit 2024, an MoU with Microsoft to enhance Qatar Museums’ smart experiences, and several other agreements.

Regarding the most prominent outcomes of the ICOFOM 2024 conference, hosted by Qatar Museums with the aim of enhancing international cooperation and raising awareness of the importance of museums, Al Rumaihi stated that the conference explored museum practices in the Arab region.

It focused on issues of sustainability, innovation, educational models, the use of modern technologies, joint artistic evaluation, balancing historical perspectives, and encouraging knowledge sharing between generations.

He added that this event aimed to enhance sustainability within the museum sector, aligning with the United Nations 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.

Regarding the most prominent activities and events held by Qatar Museums over the past year, aimed at promoting learning within the community, Al Rumaihi emphasized that Qatar Museums is dedicated to offering a wide range of workshops, conferences, and training courses tailored to meet the needs of school teachers.

It also provides numerous programs designed for children of all ages, along with various educational materials and engaging activities that teachers and parents can utilize both at school and at home.

He noted that all activities align with the professional standards set by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, as well as national curriculum standards.

For instance, the Education and Community Awareness Department at the Museum of Islamic Art is focused on developing programs that broaden participants’ horizons and deepen their knowledge of Islamic arts.

These programs adopt various approaches to enrich the museum experience, such as integrating technology into new workshops, exploring Islamic heritage through tangible objects, and creating exact replicas of famous artworks.

These replicas are presented to visitors, especially children, allowing them to examine, explore, and understand the details, textures, and materials of these works more closely. 

Regarding the most important international art exhibitions organized by Qatar Museums over the past year, CEO of Qatar Museums Mohammed Saad Al Rumaihi said that the year was marked by several distinguished exhibitions.

These included ""MANZAR: Art and Architecture from Pakistan 1940s to Today,"" which showcased the vibrant and diverse art scenes of Pakistan and its global communities. Another highlight was ""Between a Look and a Look: Gerome, Art and Influence,"" the first major exhibition of the artist in the Middle East.

Additionally, ""Splendours of the Atlas: A Voyage Through Morocco’s Heritage,"" explored the rich heritage of Islamic art in Morocco, while ""Ellsworth Kelly at 100"" was the first retrospective exhibition of the American painter and sculptor in the Middle East.

These exhibitions were made possible through collaborative initiatives within Qatar Museums institutions, including partnerships between the future Lusail Museum, Mathaf: Arab Museum of Modern Art, the future Art Mill Museum, and the National Museum of Qatar, Al Rumiahi pointed out.

He mentioned that the Museum of Islamic Art hosted two exhibitions linked to the Qatar Years of Culture initiative, a national program that fosters long-term cultural partnerships between Qatar and other countries.

As for the 3-2-1 Qatar Olympic and Sports Museum, it launched a traveling exhibition in Paris titled ""Esports | A Game Changer,"" alongside the exhibition ""Olympic Thought: Values and Peaks"" which chronicles 40 years of Qatar’s participation in the Olympic Games, coinciding with the Summer Olympic Games.

Shortly after the exhibition’s opening, and as part of the Qatar team reception organized by the Qatar Olympic Committee in Paris for the Olympic Games, Qatar Museums presented, for the first time, the book ""Pierre de Coubertin Selected Writings / Volume 1: Revelation.

""This included a copy of the first Arabic translation of Pierre de Coubertin’s ‘Selected Texts,’ by the French historian widely regarded as the father of the modern Olympic Games, Al Rumaihi added.

Regarding Qatar Museums’ plans to develop projects for creative and innovative designers in the fields of design, creativity, and entrepreneurship, in light of the transformation of the M7 Center into an incubator for professional and talented designers, the CEO of Qatar Museums explained that the establishment of the M7 Center was aimed at exploring, collaborating with, and developing thriving businesses.

He emphasized that Qatar Museums work to provide all the necessary tools and expertise for designers to transform their ideas from concept to market, and aim to meet the demands of the advanced Qatari fashion and design labor market.

He explained that last year saw the launch of the Qatar Museums ""Design Doha"" biennial exhibition celebrating excellence and innovation in the design community in Qatar and the broader Middle East and North Africa region.

Organized by the Design Doha program under the patronage of HE Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad Al-Thani, the Chairperson of the Board of Trustees of Qatar Museums, the event serves as a new platform for Arab designers to showcase their work, explore their future career paths, and interact with renowned designers from around the world.

The first edition of the ""Design Doha"" biennial was held last year, featuring numerous special events and exhibitions.

The second edition of the event will take place this year, further solidifying its role in enriching the region’s creative activities and serving as a vital hub for innovation.

The inaugural edition attracted around 22,000 visitors over the course of a week.

News,us,post,305102488,2025-03-28,"Why Benjamin Netanyahu Is Going Back to War On March 18th, with the Trump Administration’s approval, Israeli aircraft renewed the bombing of Gaza. Raids killed at least five senior Hamas officials. They also killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, some four hundred people, more than two-thirds of whom were women and children. Since then, both Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen have resumed firing rockets and missiles at Israel, setting off air-raid sirens in the center of the country; and Israeli ground forces have pushed into the Netzarim Corridor, once again cutting Gaza in half. Rockets were also fired from Lebanon at the northern Israeli town of Metula. It’s hard now to see what will stop the escalation.
Netanyahu’s office said that the strikes were necessary because Hamas had rejected proposals—advanced by the Trump Administration’s envoy, Steve Witkoff—to extend the ceasefire agreement, which had been in place since January 19th, by negotiating the release of more hostages. “Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” the Prime Minister’s office said in a statement. From now on. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a group representing almost all the families of the remaining hostages, was having none of it. It called for mass demonstrations and issued a statement accusing Netanyahu of “abandoning” their loved ones while engaging in “complete deception.”
On Saturday night, more than a hundred thousand people joined those demonstrations in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Two major opposition leaders, the Democrats’ Yair Golan and Yair Lapid, of the centrist party Yesh Atid, each called for civil disobedience: a mass refusal to pay taxes and a general strike. On Channel 12, a third, center-right party leader, National Unity’s usually circumspect Gadi Eisenkot, endorsed their stand. The three pledged to form a single democratic bloc to bring down the government. “We are stopping the economy, the ports, transportation, the schools, academia, businesses and the streets,” Golan, who was shoved to the ground by police at a recent demonstration, said. “We are stopping the country—to save it.”
The ceasefire agreement consisted of two phases, the first of which ended at the beginning of March. Hamas (and Islamic Jihad) released thirty-three hostages (and the bodies of eight more) in return for nearly two thousand Palestinian prisoners. The second phase, which should have been under negotiation by now, was meant to arrange for the return of the remaining living hostages, believed to be twenty-four people, in exchange for an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza—and a change of government there. Notionally, Hamas would be replaced by a new regionally supported Palestinian administration. Once it was in place, the Saudis were expected to join in the underwriting of Gazan reconstruction and in normalizing relations with Israel.
But, from the start of the war, Netanyahu has obstructed any effort to set up a new Palestinian governing structure, because that would inevitably engage the Palestinian Authority, and would thus be a step toward eventual Palestinian independence. Harel told me that Netanyahu’s government is now not only authoritarian in style but also “brazenly theocratic,” aiming for, among other things, incorporating into Israel “Judea and Samaria”—the occupied West Bank. An alternative administration for Gaza is not, though, entirely hypothetical. Earlier this month, Western-aligned Arab states assembled in Cairo, where they detailed plans for a government of Palestinian “technocrats”—adjacent to and legitimatized, but not chosen, by the P.A., which controls parts of the West Bank, under the auspices of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Egypt and Jordan pledged to offer security support. Some fifty-three billion dollars, presumably in large part from the Gulf states, would be funnelled into reconstruction. Hamas would consent to an interim administration, though it was left unclear what would be done about its armed units.
“All Palestinian parties see the P.L.O. as the unifying umbrella for the struggle against occupation,” Samir Hulileh, the former C.E.O. of the huge Palestinian conglomerate PADICO (and a potential candidate “technocrat” for a new government), told me. “Hamas could be integrated into the P.L.O., once it agrees on its charter and past agreements with Israel.” It would then be “a political party, not a militia, and even compete in future elections.” Its guns would be handed over to a Palestinian police force to be established in Gaza and commanded by the P.A., which, in turn, could recruit police officers from Hamas and, crucially, pay their salaries. The business community in the West Bank as a whole is mobilized, in despair over mounting violence by settlers and the Israeli military in that territory, in addition to the violence in Gaza. (PADICO has invested more than three hundred and fifty million dollars in real estate in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The company’s chairman, Bashar Masri, independently built Rawabi, a one-and-a-half-billion-dollar planned city, near Ramallah, designed to accommodate forty thousand residents.) And for Egypt there is urgency in advancing the regional alliance that rebuilding Gaza requires. Houthi attacks have caused the diversion of most shipping from the Red Sea to a route around South Africa. This has, among other losses, reduced Egyptian revenue from the Suez Canal by about eight hundred million dollars a month.
Witkoff, however, was offering not a Phase Two but a sort of Phase One-lite: half the remaining hostages in exchange for a fifty-day truce. At that point—the hostages’ families might reasonably fear—Netanyahu could proceed to reoccupy Gaza, potentially “abandoning” the remaining hostages. (His populist and messianic coalition partners are already enthusing over Trump’s fantastical plan for U.S. custodianship of—and the Gazans’ removal from—the Strip.) In other words, Phase Two has evaporated. Netanyahu claims that Hamas has rejected all compromise—a point that Witkoff, curiously, seemed to cast doubt on in an interview with Tucker Carlson on March 21st. Meanwhile, with so many enraged youth in Gaza, Hamas and Islamic Jihad have reportedly recruited new fighters—not enough to threaten Israel but more than enough to intimidate Gazans. By Netanyahu’s logic, the bombing must continue until Hamas simply capitulates but, illogically, releases the hostages first.
Netanyahu’s justification for renewed war is a deception, also, because it is his culminating move in a political struggle that will determine whether Israel remains an open society; and the rival camps in this contest map closely onto those who fought over his government’s so-called judicial reform, in 2023. That gambit aimed to curtail the Supreme Court’s ability to set constitutional limits on the Netanyahu government’s actions. And, in both cases, the Netanyahu coalition’s transparent concern is an old one: to advance annexation and sustain theocracy—and to preëmpt, respectively, Palestinian independence and Israeli liberalism.“Establishing a religious autocracy on the ruins of Israel’s already battered democracy has always been and remains the government’s primary mission,” the Haaretz editor Aluf Benn wrote, earlier this month. The government is now “approaching this task anew,” but, this time, it is “facing less protest and a weaker opposition.”
On the surface, Benn’s assessment may be too gloomy. According to a recent survey from the Israel Democracy Institute, some seventy per cent of Israelis believe that Netanyahu should take responsibility for October 7th and resign. Some seventy per cent also want a comprehensive deal to end the war and bring the hostages home. And polls consistently show Netanyahu falling short of another majority in the Knesset. But seventy per cent also oppose a Palestinian state. And one poll found that eighty per cent like the sound of Trump’s proposal to have Jordan, say, take in the residents of Gaza to help “clean out” the Strip, although any such move would severely undermine Jordan’s Hashemite regime.
Netanyahu, in short, is not as popular as his antipathies. So he is playing for time and letting them fester. The Guardian reports that the Prime Minister has threatened to “finish the job” of preventing an Iranian bomb—and is hoping to gain the Trump Administration’s support for an attack. He need not face the voters until the end of 2026, now that his far-right coalition partners passed a budget earlier this week—despite his government’s fiscal predations. The economy, the Hebrew University economist Joseph Zeira says, is in severe recession—a twenty-per-cent decline in over-all investment, whose impact on unemployment is temporarily offset by a high number of reservists who have been called up for service. More than eighty thousand Israelis left the country in 2024. Yet the government is proposing to cut the salaries of teachers and civil servants, while steering more than one and a quarter billion dollars to ultra-Orthodox parties and schools and West Bank settlements.
Netanyahu may remain electorally vulnerable, then, but the electorate will be vulnerable to the appeal of hard-liners. (The former leader of the Jewish Home party, Naftali Bennett, is waiting in the wings.) Besides, Netanyahu is making collateral moves that, Yair Golan fears, portend “unfair elections.” Netanyahu has renewed efforts to hand the Knesset the power to supersede Supreme Court rulings; on Thursday, he pushed through a law giving the government control over appointments to the Court. He has moved to shift power over the elections commission from the courts to the Knesset, in order to facilitate the suppression of Arab-Israeli political parties. And he has threatened the closure of the independent public broadcaster, Kan. Much like Donald Trump, Netanyahu is flooding the zone, maneuvering the public into a diplomatic trap that engenders a sense of unravelling and, over time, makes effective political dissent difficult.
“Shortly after the war started, when Netanyahu looked finished, over forty per cent of Israelis showed clinical level symptoms of depression and anxiety,” the psychologist Yoav Groweiss told me. (He is part of a team at the Ruppin Academic Center which has been conducting a nationwide study of public health since October 7th.) “Those numbers slowly declined, but, simultaneously, people began reporting much higher levels of concern about existential threats regarding national security and economic stability. Try finding a couples therapist or child psychologist with an open slot today.” Netanyahu “makes these many-sided threats seem endemic to the region,” Groweiss said, “endemic to Jewish history and liturgy—not the consequence of his use of power but, if anything, the justification of his power.”
Indeed, Hamas has been largely defeated by the I.D.F., is increasingly discredited among ordinary Gazans (in recent days, anti-Hamas demonstrations have broken out in multiple locations), and is all but isolated owing to the military collapse of Hezbollah and the Assad regime in Syria. Yet Israelis so object to the prospect of Hamas exercising residual control in Gaza that Netanyahu’s messaging plays. Golan, for his part, was the I.D.F.’s deputy chief of staff from 2014 to 2017. On the morning of October 7th, he drove toward the site of the Nova Music Festival, to rescue people who had fled the Hamas attack there. He does not want Hamas in any position of control, either, but the question he asks is whether apprehension justifies resuming the war.
“I say, the hostages first,” he told me earlier this week, and if Hamas ever again represents a threat, “we can fight again.” But why fight before trying diplomacy? Netanyahu has “made no attempt to turn military successes into a replacement for Hamas, or any larger diplomatic move,” Golan said. “This is shameful.” Israel, he said, starting in enclaves near Rafah and Gaza City, could “introduce security forces from the Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordanians. Expand the U.S.-backed multinational force monitoring the Sinai north into Gaza. New P.A. battalions can be trained.” Meanwhile, investment would begin. “The new forces would secure civilian contractors. Young people could then vote with their feet. What do you want to do? Go to war? Or go to work, for ten times the salary?”
Netanyahu, instead of making “diplomatic moves” is bent on installing loyalists in the military and the security services. Both the I.D.F. and the security service, Shin Bet, released internal performance reviews, revealing operational inertia and the botched use of available intelligence. Both had apparently assumed, prior to October 7th, that Hamas could be deterred by periodic eruptions of overwhelming violence, or else be bought off by cash from Qatar. The heads of the groups—the I.D.F chief of staff, Herzl Halevi, and the Shin Bet commander, Ronen Bar—announced that they accepted responsibility for institutional failures and that they intended to resign.
Yet the real problem, they say, was strategic complacency that flowed from the top. Since 2009, Netanyahu had pushed the idea that Hamas’s rule in Gaza was a kind of strategic asset—it debased the P.A. and kept the Palestinians divided. Halevi and Bar have called for a state commission of inquiry, which would almost certainly implicate Netanyahu and demand that he accept his responsibility.
Instead, Netanyahu complained of a “deep state,” and replaced Halevi with Eyal Zamir, a gruff former armored-division commander—and former military secretary to Netanyahu—who has acted to undermine any potential state commission and is managing the renewed attack on Hamas and the settler-friendly occupation force in the West Bank. (On Monday, the co-director of the Oscar-winning documentary “No Other Land,” Hamdan Ballal, was beaten by a settler—while soldiers stood back—during an attack on the village of Susiya, where Ballal lives; he was detained and then turned over to the police, who arrested him.)
As for Bar, who had become a key hostage negotiator, he was fired on March 20th, before his intended resignation date. The Shin Bet had begun investigating highly placed members of Netanyahu’s staff regarding a recent leak of purloined Hamas negotiating documents, a supposed effort to enhance Netanyahu’s image, and for taking payments for public-relations work from Qatar—including in 2022, while it was funding Hamas. Netanyahu, ignoring the clear conflict of interest, simply claimed that Bar had been too “soft” in negotiations with Hamas. Gali Baharav-Miara, the attorney general, stepped in, and insisted on examining “the factual and legal basis” underlying the dismissal. The Supreme Court concurred with the attorney general; now Netanyahu’s government is proceeding to fire Baharav-Miara, too. Overnight, demonstrations against the war and for the hostages morphed into a renewed civil action to enshrine due process and democratic norms. Israel’s President, Isaac Herzog, fears a breakdown. “What level of madness can we reach as a nation?” he said.
In this context, Netanyahu’s tightening control over the parts of the military seems ominous. “When the state was created, Ben-Gurion had to force ideologically strident militias into a single professional, secular army,” the military historian Yoram Peri told me. Bibi, he said, seems to be re-creating a split. About forty per cent of the graduates of the Army’s infantry officer schools, Peri notes, come from the dati leumi, or nationalist Orthodox minority, many of them extremist yeshiva students and supporters of settlements. “Zamir,” the new I.D.F. chief, “is their kind of commander,” Peri said. “A professionalized, secular army is not their goal. Neither is a secular democratic society.” ♦",,https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/why-benjamin-netanyahu-is-going-back-to-war,,,us,,news,,,,,,1,10,,2,,,newyorker.com,,,,,,,,negative,0.9730889797210693

News,US,post,304425216,2025-03-26,"Netanyahu Takes Desperate Measures In a little more than a week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has reignited the war in Gaza, dismissed the head of Israel’s internal security agency, and moved to fire its highest legal official—all while pushing toward a political takeover of the judicial branch.

That Netanyahu is taking all of these actions at once is not a coincidence: He knows he faces immediate threats to his hold on power, and so he is taking desperate measures, regardless of the cost in lives and the risk to Israeli democracy.

The sudden wave of Israeli bombing raids on Gaza last Tuesday marked the collapse of the cease-fire-and-hostage deal between Israel and Hamas. Under that agreement, the two sides were supposed to exploit the pause in fighting to negotiate the next stage of the deal, including a permanent cease-fire and the release of the remaining Israeli hostages.

Why the failure to reach the second stage? To solely blame the huge gap between the negotiating positions of Israel and Hamas is tempting, but mistaken. The abyss was real—but negotiations to bridge it never began. Had Netanyahu actually been interested in reaching an agreement, he could have considered—or sought to improve—the proposal for Gaza’s future that Egypt and other Arab states put forward. That plan laid out a path, however uncertain, toward rebuilding Gaza and creating an alternative Palestinian government there.

But Netanyahu was most likely concerned less with resolving the conflict in Gaza than with preserving his government past March 31. Under Israeli law, if the current year’s budget isn’t approved by that date, Parliament’s term automatically ends and new elections must be held within 90 days. And polls consistently suggest that Netanyahu stands very little chance of reelection, as the parties that make up his coalition appear to fall far short of winning a majority again.

As of mid-March, however, Netanyahu couldn’t count on passing a budget in the 120-member Knesset. One of his partners, the far-right Jewish Power party, had bolted from the coalition after the hostage-and-cease-fire deal was signed in mid-January—with the party’s leader, Itamar Ben-Gvir, declaring that it would return to the government only “if the war is resumed, with might” to bring a decisive victory. That left Netanyahu with a 62-member coalition—and two of those members were threatening to vote against the budget unless the government first passed an intensely unpopular law to restore a draft exemption for ultra-Orthodox men.

The stance of another extreme nationalist party, Religious Zionism, made the coalition even more fragile. When the hostage deal was reached, the party’s leader, Bezalel Smotrich, said that Religious Zionism was staying in the government only because Netanyahu had promised to resume intensive fighting “to achieve absolute victory” by “taking control over all of the Gaza Strip.” If Israel proceeded to the second stage of the deal, Smotrich’s party would leave, and the coalition would lose its parliamentary majority.

The first air attacks on Gaza last Tuesday took place before dawn. By the same evening, Netanyahu and Ben-Gvir had agreed on Jewish Power’s return to the government. The coalition appears safe. But some two dozen Israeli hostages who were reportedly still alive in the tunnels of Gaza are in immediate danger from their captors and from Israeli fire.

Meanwhile, hundreds of Gazans have reportedly been killed in the past week of Israeli attacks, with the proportion of civilians and combatants unknown. Sporadic missile attacks from Gaza, Yemen, and Lebanon again have Israelis dashing for shelter. The government hasn’t explained how it expects to reach the “absolute victory” that has so far eluded it. Hebrew-language media reports suggest that the goal is to restore an Israeli military government over much of the Strip. That’s a recipe for a war of attrition and Israeli casualties, as General Herzi Halevi—the recently replaced chief of staff—reportedly argued.

But the hard right will be satisfied, and the coalition succeeded in passing the budget this week, preventing new elections. No wonder that the former head of the Mossad, Tamir Pardo, declared at a huge anti-government rally in Tel Aviv the night after the fighting resumed, “The War for the Welfare of Netanyahu has begun.”

Yet Netanyahu faces another, potentially greater threat, in what’s known as Qatargate: The Shin Bet internal security agency and police are investigating an alleged financial connection between several of the prime minister’s closest aides and the government of Qatar, a key backer of Hamas. Netanyahu’s critics charge that he may well have fired Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar last week in an effort to shut down that investigation. It stands to reason that the cabinet vote this week to dismiss the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, could be similarly motivated.

Qatargate emerged in late November, when Haaretz reported that the Netanyahu associates Yonatan Urich and Yisrael (Srulik) Einhorn had conducted a public-relations campaign for Qatar in the lead-up to the 2022 World Cup in that country. The goal was to transform Qatar’s image from a backer of terror to a contributor to Middle East peace. Einhorn had been a consultant on five of Netanyahu’s election campaigns. In 2022, Urich was the spokesperson of Netanyahu’s Likud party, which was then briefly in the opposition. Today he is media adviser to the prime minister. (Urich denied the report; Einhorn’s PR firm called it “fake news.”)

The revelations about Urich and Einhorn’s work for Qatar did not immediately imply criminal activity. It resonated, though, because the two aides were already suspects in the leaking of a top-secret intelligence document to the German newspaper Bild, allegedly to deflect criticism of Netanyahu’s stonewalling of a hostage deal. Another Netanyahu spokesperson, Eli Feldstein, is under indictment for his alleged role in that leak.

Moreover, the Haaretz report suggested that two men with Netanyahu’s ear—one working daily with the prime minister—had financial ties to Qatar. And until October 7, 2023, Netanyahu was allowing Qatar to send suitcases of cash to Gaza to prop up the Hamas government there. The unanswered question was whether the two facts were connected.

Then, in early February, Israel’s Channel 12 reported that Feldstein himself had done PR work for a foreign firm on behalf of Qatar, while serving as a spokesperson for Netanyahu. At the end of that month, Baharav-Miara announced a joint Shin Bet–police investigation of the affair.

Because of a gag order, little more is known of the inquiry, except this: Last Wednesday evening, Urich and Feldstein were taken in for interrogation. They are reportedly suspected of bribery, money laundering, and contact with a foreign agent. (Einhorn has been living in Serbia, beyond the reach of Israeli investigators.)

Nothing so far reported ties Netanyahu directly to the affair—except for his furious reaction. The night his aides were questioned, Netanyahu posted on X, “In America and in Israel, when a strong right wing leader wins an election, the leftist Deep State weaponizes the justice system to thwart the people’s will.”

The next night, the cabinet unanimously approved Netanyahu’s request to fire Bar, the Shin Bet chief. Several groups appealed the legality of this decision, and Baharav-Miara ruled that the dismissal must first be submitted to the same independent committee that originally approved Bar for the position. The cabinet ignored the attorney general’s ruling—and on Sunday voted no confidence in her as well, initiating her dismissal.

The timing of Bar’s firing suggests a possible connection to Qatargate. Bar had already acknowledged that he shared responsibility for the intelligence failure that allowed Hamas to attack on October 7. He had said that he planned to resign before the end of his term in 2026. But the investigation of Qatargate looked to be moving on a faster track than Bar’s plans, and Netanyahu may wish to appoint a replacement whose loyalty will belong to the prime minister, not the law.

The bid to dismiss Baharav-Miara would also be less surprising but for the timing. Baharav-Miara has been in constant conflict with the cabinet—not because she has stepped out of line, but because she has stood against the Netanyahu government’s moves to concentrate power in its hands. And yet, until now, Netanyahu has ignored ministers’ calls to dismiss her, apparently because he faces corruption charges and does not want to invite court intervention by firing the chief prosecutor. With Qatargate before him, however, he gave Justice Minister Yariv Levin the go-ahead to bring the no-confidence vote in the cabinet.

To all of that, add the continuing push for “judicial reform”: Tomorrow the Knesset is set to vote on legislation to change how judges are appointed in Israel and give greater power to politicians, especially those in the ruling coalition. This has been one of the government’s central goals since early 2023.

The timing of that parliamentary vote is not directly linked to Qatargate or the war. But it does have the effect of flooding the zone—of overwhelming the parliamentary opposition and the popular protest movement while they are focused on the war, the hostages, and the attacks on Bar and Baharav-Miara.

The next chapters of this story will play out partly in the courts and partly on the streets. The supreme court has already issued a temporary order freezing Bar’s dismissal. Cabinet ministers have declared that the government should ignore the court. Major business leaders have threatened a national shutdown in response. Street protests—against the war, for saving the hostages, for democracy—have swelled again, with massive rallies in Tel Aviv and near-constant demonstrations outside Netanyahu’s house in Jerusalem. What has become clear to many Israelis is that for the sake of his political survival, Netanyahu is prepared to make his country pay almost any price.",,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/03/netanyahu-desperate-measures/682177/,,,us,,news,,,,,,6,7,,11,,,theatlantic.com,,,,,,,,negative,0.9979456067085266
News,us,post,304375060,2025-03-26,"Uzbekistan’s Evolving Northern Afghanistan Strategy Afghan-Uzbek relations are expected to reach to a new high in 2025. Last year, the two countries stated aims to increase bilateral trade turnover to $3 billion. The planned construction of an Uzbek trade center, covering an area of 220 square meters, in Mazar-i-Sharif along with an effort for intensifying the implementation of the Trans-Afghan transport corridor might further solidify bilateral pragmatic cooperation between the two neighbors. Over the last three years, Uzbekistan has pursued a proactive foreign policy toward Taliban-led Afghanistan based on its own strategic interests. Tashkent’s long-lasting obsession with a security-oriented approach has been traded for a pragmatic, economy-first foreign policy in relation to Kabul. Adopting a flexible and multivector approach to its Afghan policy might incur potential reputational risks for Uzbekistan’s international image. However, the current geopolitical reality and the historical links between Afghanistan and Central Asia underscore the significance of the country for Uzbekistan’s foreign policy priorities. Historical Context Tashkent’s foreign policy orientation toward Afghanistan is largely focused on the northern provinces. Historically, the two sides of the Oxus (the modern Amu Darya) were deeply connected through ethnic, historical, and cultural ties. The Afghan provinces of Balkh, Jowzjan, Faryab, Sar-e Pol, Takhar, and Kunduz, where a significant Uzbek community resides, have long been closely connected to the civilizational space of Mavarannahr (also called Transoxiana), the legacy of which modern Uzbekistan upholds. Some northern Afghan territories maintained administrative and political ties with the Emirate of Bukhara until the late 19th century, highlighting the longevity and depth of shared historical heritage. This factor plays a crucial role in shaping contemporary Afghan-Uzbek relations, providing a foundation for sustainable partnership. Even during the tenure of Uzbekistan’s first president, when Tashkent officially exercised caution regarding Afghanistan, engagement with northern Afghanistan – particularly with the leader of the Uzbek community, Abdul Rashid Dostum – remained stable. Over time, historical-cultural ties led to practical steps. A key contribution by Uzbekistan to the region’s infrastructure development was the construction of the 75-km Hairatan-Mazar-i-Sharif railway, completed in 2011 using its own funds. However, during that period, Tashkent’s priorities were primarily focused on security issues, and northern Afghanistan was regarded as a buffer zone ensuring strategic stability along Uzbekistan’s southern borders from the early 1990s to 2021. Economic Context Economic factors are playing a significant role in contemporary Afghan-Uzbek relations, shifting the focus away from security concerns. In recent years, Uzbekistan has actively expanded trade and economic cooperation with Afghanistan, establishing an International Trade Center in Termez, at the border, which has significantly boosted bilateral trade turnover. As part of furthering economic engagement, plans are under consideration to open a similar center in Mazar-i-Sharif, creating additional conditions for expanding trade and investment cooperation between the two countries. Afghanistan, with its population of 41 million, represents a promising market for Uzbek goods. Currently, multiple countries – including China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Iran, Qatar, and the UAE – are showing interest in the Afghan market. Given the increasing competition, Tashkent faces the challenge of maintaining and strengthening its economic position in Afghanistan at a time when others are eyeing much the same. While Afghanistan’s southern provinces are traditionally oriented toward Pakistan and its western regions toward Iran, Uzbekistan has the opportunity to sustain and expand its economic influence in the north. In this context, cultural and historical ties play a crucial role, fostering local preference for Uzbek goods and services in northern Afghanistan. This factor provides Tashkent with a strategic advantage in the competition for the Afghan market. Qosh-Tepa Factor The transformation of Uzbek foreign policy toward Afghanistan has manifested in its approach to the Qosh-Tepa Canal project. The Uzbek government has notably refrained from emphasizing the potential water-related tensions that may arise from the initiative. This careful approach can be attributed to the recognition that, for the sake of its own security, Tashkent has come to understanding the importance of fostering economic development in northern Afghanistan as a means of ensuring regional stability. Consequently, the prevailing consensus in Tashkent underscores the prioritization of security through economic cooperation and socio-economic development strategies. Uzbekistan’s approach to the canal project arguably demonstrates the evolving trajectory of Uzbek foreign policy toward Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the development of agriculture and irrigation infrastructure in Afghanistan’s northern provinces contributes to improving living standards of local communities, and thereby strengthens bilateral relations between Tashkent and Kabul. In this context, Uzbekistan supports the implementation of the Qosh-Tepa project, provided it adheres to international norms and standards, ensuring the minimization of potential environmental risks and long-term benefits for all stakeholders. Soft Power Uzbekistan has placed a significant emphasis on educational initiatives in northern Afghanistan, viewing them as key factors in mutual understanding and eventually fostering the regional stability. In this regard, Tashkent has sponsored the construction of the “Khair al-Mudaris Imam Bukhari” madrassa in Mazar-i-Sharif. The institution is reportedly planned to be built with Uzbek-backed financial support amounting to $6 million and accommodating 1,000 students. Tashkent believes that establishing such a joint educational institution might facilitate the development of a unified approach to religious education, which will eventually minimize the risk of radical ideologies spreading and strengthen the region’s spiritual security. Additionally, such a madrassa’s activities appear to foster a positive perception of Uzbekistan among Afghanistan’s religious community, which plays a crucial role in socio-political processes and governance. Thus, Uzbekistan’s involvement in preparing Afghanistan’s intellectual elite could become a vital instrument of its soft power strategy, contributing to the country’s long-term influence in the region. Challenges Although the Taliban appear to view Uzbekistan’s growing interest in northern Afghanistan as a positive development and recognize Tashkent as a key economic partner, several existing challenges could impact the development of bilateral relations. First, the Taliban’s conscious and subtle push toward changing the ethnic landscape of the northern regions of Afghanistan could shift the balance in these provinces. Pashtuns, with their distinct cultural and historical background, may be less receptive to Tashkent’s initiatives in the area. In the long run, these developments might influence Uzbekistan’s strategic approach toward northern Afghanistan and could necessitate adjustments to it. Second, Chinese influence in the northern regions of Afghanistan is growing. Chinese investments in extracting oil from the Amu Darya delta and the development of the Wakhan Corridor project could potentially shift local economic preferences in China’s favor, which might affect conditions for Uzbek investments in the region. Nevertheless, this process might present opportunities for Chinese-Uzbek cooperation aimed at transforming northern Afghanistan into a key transit hub for international projects, thereby enhancing Tashkent’s regional influence and advancing its economic interests. Third, the implementation of international energy projects such as TAPI and CASA-1000 could lead to the Afghan energy market’s reorientation toward Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. This, in turn, may reduce Uzbekistan’s humanitarian assistance to northern Afghanistan while simultaneously diminishing Afghanistan’s reliance on energy cooperation with Uzbekistan. A weakening of energy diplomacy could impact the overall nature of bilateral relations. Conclusion Uzbekistan has recognized Afghanistan as a part of the broader Central Asian region, at least in discourse. The primary projects being implemented and planned by Uzbekistan are concentrated in the northern parts of Afghanistan, underscoring its strategic importance within Uzbekistan’s foreign policy framework. Notably, Uzbekistan’s approach to the Qosh-Tepa Canal project as a development issue and a potential point for bilateral collaboration overweigh, at least for now, concerns about water security. In this context, Tashkent’s policy extends beyond its traditional national security concerns to encompass broader objectives – enhancing regional stability and socio-economic development – which, in turn, contribute to the long-term strengthening of Afghan-Uzbek relations. In the end, the water from the canal feeds Uzbeks inhabiting both sides of the border.",,https://thediplomat.com/2025/03/uzbekistans-evolving-northern-afghanistan-strategy/,,,us,,news,,,,,,3,5,,12,,,thediplomat.com,,,,,,,,positive,0.9863110184669495
News,us,post,303460980,2025-03-24,"Kabul reports the U.S. removed rewards for Sirajuddin Haqqani and additional top Taliban members The U.S. has lifted bounties on three senior Taliban figures, including the interior minister who also heads a powerful network blamed for bloody attacks against Afghanistan’s former Western-backed government, officials in Kabul said Sunday.

Sirajuddin Haqqani, who acknowledged planning a January 2008 attack on the Serena Hotel in Kabul, which killed six people, including U.S. citizen Thor David Hesla, no longer appears on the State Department’s Rewards for Justice website. The FBI website still featured a wanted poster for him on Sunday.

Interior Ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani said the U.S. government had revoked the bounties placed on Haqqani, Abdul Aziz Haqqani and Yahya Haqqani.

“These three individuals are two brothers and one paternal cousin,” Qani told The Associated Press.

The Haqqani network grew into one of the deadliest arms of the Taliban after the U.S.-led 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. The group employed roadside bombs, suicide bombings and other attacks, including on the Indian and U.S. embassies, the Afghan presidency, and other major targets. They also have been linked to extortion, kidnapping and other criminal activity.

A Foreign Ministry official, Zakir Jalaly, said the Taliban’s release of U.S. prisoner George Glezmann on Friday and the removal of bounties showed both sides were “moving beyond the effects of the wartime phase and taking constructive steps to pave the way for progress” in bilateral relations.

“The recent developments in Afghanistan-U.S. relations are a good example of the pragmatic and realistic engagement between the two governments,” Jalaly said.

Another official, Shafi Azam, hailed the development as the beginning of normalization, also citing the Taliban’s announcement that they were in control of Afghanistan’s embassy in Norway.

Since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, China has been the most prominent country to accept one of its diplomats. Other countries have accepted de facto Taliban representatives, such as Qatar, which has been a key mediator between the U.S. and the Taliban. U.S. envoys have also met the Taliban.

The Taliban rule, especially bans affecting women and girls, has drawn widespread condemnation and deepened their international isolation.

Haqqani has previously spoken out against the Taliban’s decision-making process, authoritarianism and alienation of the Afghan population.

He has been under U.N. sanctions since 2007, because of his involvement with the network founded by his father, Jalaluddin.

But the global body has allowed him to travel in the past 12 months, including to the United Arab Emirates to meet the country’s leadership and to Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage. Those were his first trips abroad since the Taliban takeover.

Ibraheem Bahiss, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group’s Asia program, said the removal of the bounties was a win for Taliban officials wanting to do business with the international community. The U.S. is showing it can reward those who make compromises within their own remit, even if these compromises don’t translate to national policy, he said.

The international community had made demands of the Taliban, specifically lifting restrictions on women and girls, but offered nothing in return, Bahiss said. Scrapping bounties was a sign that small diplomatic overtures were possible.

While recognition as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan might not immediately be on the horizon, the Taliban views normalization as enough progress given their existing diplomatic inroads in the region, according to Bahiss.

“For the Taliban, the removal of sanctions is more important than (official) recognition. Sanctions bite. They inhibit your ability to do business, to travel. That’s why they would celebrate this as a victory. The transactional nature of this diplomacy suits both the Taliban and Trump.”

His partial rehabilitation on the international stage is in contrast to the status of the reclusive Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, who could face arrest by the International Criminal Court for his persecution of women.",,https://internewscast.com/news/us/kabul-reports-the-u-s-removed-rewards-for-sirajuddin-haqqani-and-additional-top-taliban-members/,,,us,,news,,,,,,5,6,,8,,,internewscast.com,,,,,,,,positive,0.8997322916984558
News,us,post,303356324,2025-03-23,"A legal showdown looms in Israel as Netanyahu moves to oust top officials TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel again is fighting a war on multiple fronts, but a battle is also brewing inside the country.

Tens of thousands of Israelis have joined anti-government protests in recent days. A former Supreme Court chief justice has warned of civil war. And experts are saying a constitutional crisis could be on the horizon if the Israeli government moves ahead with plans to fire top legal and security officials.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced last week he was firing Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet internal security service, citing a crisis of confidence sparked by the failures to prevent Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. Netanyahu’s government has also launched a process to dismiss the attorney general, accusing her of obstructing its agenda.

The moves come as the Shin Bet is investigating a possible infiltration of Netanyahu’s office by an Arab country and as Netanyahu is on trial for corruption.

They are setting up a showdown between Netanyahu and the judiciary that is deepening divisions in Israel and could set off upheaval at a time when Israel is bogged down by war.

Tensions between the government and state institutions

Netanyahu’s government launched a sweeping overhaul of the judiciary in early 2023, a process that touched off mass protests.

Critics said the overhaul would undermine the country’s delicate system of checks and balances by granting too much power to Netanyahu. He and his governing coalition argued the judiciary had become overly interventionist and was blocking its legislative agenda.

Opponents also criticized Netanyahu for promoting the changes while on trial for corruption. They say a strong and independent judiciary is a necessary safeguard against authoritarian rule.

Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks, which sparked the war in Gaza, paused the overhaul. But it opened up new divisions in the country over who shouldered blame for not preventing the deadliest day in Israel’s history.

Netanyahu has sidestepped accepting responsibility, seeking instead to point a finger at the heads of the military and the Shin Bet. He has long blamed the “deep state” for wanting to topple his rule.

In a surprise announcement last week, Netanyahu said he was dismissing Bar, sparking mass protests by critics who said the move would undermine Israel’s independent state institutions and was meant as punishment for the Shin Bet’s investigation into Netanyahu’s office, or to derail it entirely.

The step helped usher the far-right politician Itamar Ben-Gvir back into Netanyahu’s government, bolstering the Israeli leader’s rule ahead of a key budget vote. Ben-Gvir had resigned weeks earlier to protest a temporary ceasefire, and his return to office came hours after the resumption of the war in Gaza.

Bar himself said he had planned to leave his post in due time, including after he wrapped up the sensitive investigations into whether the Gulf state of Qatar — which has close ties with Hamas — had hired Netanyahu advisers to launch an influence campaign in Israel. Netanyahu has suggested, with little evidence, that the probe was a result of collusion between Bar and the attorney general as a way to thwart the domestic security chief’s dismissal.

Netanyahu’s government on Sunday voted to remove Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, beginning a process that could take weeks.

Disobeying the Supreme Court could bring chaos

In a country with no official constitution and just one house of parliament that is controlled by Netanyahu’s coalition, Israel’s Supreme Court has long served as an important check on government decisions.

The decision to dismiss Bar already has been challenged at the court, which issued an injunction that froze the move until further hearings. In the coming weeks, the court will be expected to rule on whether the dismissal was legal and whether there was a conflict of interest in light of the Qatar investigation.

With the attorney general, the government passed a largely symbolic decision Sunday calling for her dismissal. A committee, which is expected to be stacked with Netanyahu’s allies, will hear the government’s and Baharav-Miara’s positions before issuing a recommendation. Only then will Netanyahu’s government make its final decision on her fate.

If the committee goes ahead with her dismissal, it will likely face a challenge in the Supreme Court. Once again, it is expected to decide whether Netanyahu has a conflict of interest because he is firing the official who serves as the head of the public prosecution’s office that is trying him for corruption.

It is unclear whether the government would accept a decision it does not like.

“The dangerous scenario is if they don’t accept the ruling,” said Amir Fuchs, a senior researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank. That would prompt a crisis over which authority’s rule should be followed — the court’s or the government’s — and could lead to chaos, he said.

Fears are mounting over internal strife

Those fears have grown since the dismissals were set in motion. In a series of media interviews this weekend, 88-year-old Aharon Barak, Israel’s preeminent legal mind, aired his concerns over the eruption of a potential civil war. He also joined nearly 20 former Supreme Court judges in a letter Sunday saying that firing the attorney general threatens the rule of law.

Opposition leader Yair Lapid called for a tax revolt if the government disobeys the ruling. The leader of the country’s top labor union said ignoring a court ruling was a red line, suggesting he might launch general strikes in response.

The warnings have been eerily similar to 2023, when the legal overhaul was announced. Tens of thousands of people poured into the streets in sustained protests.

General strikes were called and reservists threatened to not report for military service if the overhaul went ahead. Military service is compulsory for most Jews at the age of 18, but the army relies heavily on older reserve units, especially during wartime. Such internal strife was seen by some analysts as a factor in the timing of Hamas’ attack. That upheaval could be just a precursor.

“Disobeying the courts is an illegal act,” wrote commentator Nadav Eyal in the Yediot Ahronot daily. The result could be “widespread civil disobedience, the type of which the government will not survive.”

TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel again is fighting a war on multiple fronts, but a battle is also brewing inside the country.

Tens of thousands of Israelis have joined anti-government protests in recent days. A former Supreme Court chief justice has warned of civil war. And experts are saying a constitutional crisis could be on the horizon if the Israeli government moves ahead with plans to fire top legal and security officials.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced last week he was firing Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet internal security service, citing a crisis of confidence sparked by the failures to prevent Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. Netanyahu’s government has also launched a process to dismiss the attorney general, accusing her of obstructing its agenda.

The moves come as the Shin Bet is investigating a possible infiltration of Netanyahu’s office by an Arab country and as Netanyahu is on trial for corruption.

The exchange sparked concern about whether the ceasefire would hold, days after Israel relaunched its war with another Iran-backed militant group, Hamas, in Gaza. In a statement, Hezbollah denied being responsible for the attack, saying it was committed to the truce. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said it instructed the army to respond forcefully against dozens of targets in Lebanon, where the Iran-backed Hezbollah is based.

It said it struck Hezbollah command centers and dozens of rocket launchers. An Israeli strike on the southern Lebanese village of Touline killed five people, including a child, and wounded 10 others, including two children, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported. Another Israeli strike Saturday night hit a garage in the coastal city of Tyre, the NNA reported, with one person killed and seven wounded. It was the first attack on the city since the ceasefire took effect Nov. 27. And a strike on Hawsh al-Sayed Ali village along the border with Syria wounded five people, according to the NNA. In a statement, Lebanon’s prime minister, Nawaf Salam, asked the country's military to take all necessary measures in the south, but said the country does not want to return to war. Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack out of Gaza ignited the war there. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into all-out war in September as Israel carried out waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group’s senior leaders. The fighting killed over 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis. Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January under the ceasefire deal. The deadline was extended to Feb. 18, but Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon across from communities in northern Israel. Meanwhile, Israel has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah, while continuing drone attacks that have killed several members of the militant group. Lebanon has appealed to the U.N. to pressure Israel to fully withdraw. The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon said it was alarmed at the possible escalation of violence and urged all parties to avoid jeopardizing the progress made.

Israel had already cut off the supply of food, fuel, and humanitarian aid to Gaza’s roughly 2 million Palestinians, aiming to pressure Hamas over ceasefire negotiations. The international community has condemned the resumed attacks. The initial 2023 attack by Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostages. Most of the hostages have been freed in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed more than 49,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

News,us,post,303260958,2025-03-23,"The US Lifts Bounties on Senior Taliban Officials, Including Sirajuddin Haqqani, Says Kabul The U.S. has lifted bounties on three senior Taliban figures, including the interior minister who also heads a powerful network blamed for bloody attacks against Afghanistan’s former Western-backed government, officials in Kabul said Sunday.

Sirajuddin Haqqani, who acknowledged planning a January 2008 attack on the Serena Hotel in Kabul, which killed six people, including U.S. citizen Thor David Hesla, no longer appears on the State Department’s Rewards for Justice website. The FBI website on Sunday still featured a wanted poster for him.

Interior Ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani said the U.S. government had revoked the bounties placed on Haqqani, Abdul Aziz Haqqani, and Yahya Haqqani.

“These three individuals are two brothers and one paternal cousin,” Qani told The Associated Press.

The Haqqani network grew into one of the deadliest arms of the Taliban after the U.S.-led 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. The group employed roadside bombs, suicide bombings and other attacks, including on the Indian and U.S. embassies, the Afghan presidency, and other major targets. They also have been linked to extortion, kidnapping and other criminal activity.

A Foreign Ministry official, Zakir Jalaly, said the Taliban’s release of U.S. prisoner George Glezmann on Friday and the removal of bounties showed both sides were “moving beyond the effects of the wartime phase and taking constructive steps to pave the way for progress” in bilateral relations.

“The recent developments in Afghanistan-U.S. relations are a good example of the pragmatic and realistic engagement between the two governments,” said Jalaly.

Taliban see the opening in breaking out of isolation 

Another official, Shafi Azam, hailed the development as the beginning of normalization, also citing the Taliban’s announcement they were in control of Afghanistan’s embassy in Norway.

Since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, China has been the most prominent country to accept one of their diplomats. Other countries have accepted de facto Taliban representatives, like Qatar, which has been a key mediator between the U.S. and the Taliban. U.S. envoys have also met the Taliban.

The Taliban rule, especially bans affecting women and girls, has triggered widespread condemnation and deepened their international isolation.

Haqqani has previously spoken out against the Taliban’s decision-making process, authoritarianism and alienation of the Afghan population.

He has been under U.N. sanctions since 2007, because of his involvement with the network founded by his father, Jalaluddin.

But the global body has allowed him to travel in the past 12 months, including to the United Arab Emirates to meet the country’s leadership and to Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage. Those were his first trips abroad since the Taliban takeover.

Ibraheem Bahiss, a senior analyst with International Crisis Group’s Asia program, said the removal of the bounties was a win for Taliban officials wanting to do business with the international community. The U.S. was showing it could reward those who made compromises within their own remit, even if these compromises didn’t translate to national policy, he said.

The international community had made demands of the Taliban, specifically lifting restrictions on women and girls, but offered nothing in return, said Bahiss. Scrapping bounties was a sign that small diplomatic overtures were possible.

While recognition as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan might not immediately be on the horizon, the Taliban viewed normalization as enough progress given their existing diplomatic inroads in the region, according to Bahiss.

“For the Taliban, the removal of sanctions is more important than (official) recognition. Sanctions bite. They inhibit your ability to do business, to travel. That’s why they would celebrate this as a victory. The transactional nature of this diplomacy suits both the Taliban and Trump.”

His partial rehabilitation on the international stage is in contrast to the status of the reclusive Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, who could face arrest by the International Criminal Court for his persecution of women.",,https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/03/23/us-lifts-bounties-senior-taliban-officials-including-sirajuddin-haqqani-says-kabul.html,,,us,,news,,,,,,1,7,,11,,,military.com,,,,,,,,positive,0.9347464442253113

News,us,post,302279796,2025-03-20,"Thousands protest in Israel over ‘attack on democracy’ by Netanyahu Tens of thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets to call for a new ceasefire in Gaza and to protest against what they say is an attack on the country’s democracy by the rightwing governing coalition of Benjamin Netanyahu.

Key highways have been blocked and police have made at least 12 arrests amid heated scenes in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. More protests were expected in the coming days as the campaign “gathers momentum and energy”, campaigners said.

The immediate trigger for the anger was Netanyahu’s attempt to dismiss Ronen Bar, the head of the internal security agency, but the prime minister’s decision to shatter a two-month-old truce in Gaza with waves of lethal airstrikes has fuelled the demonstrations.

Protesters accuse the government of continuing the war for political reasons and ignoring the plight of the 59 hostages – about 24 of whom are believed to be alive – still held by Hamas in the devastated Palestinian territory.

“This government has now also started a war, once again, to protect itself, to divert the discourse from the things that bother the public in Israel. The government has lost all legitimacy on every possible level … They are failing,” said Eitan Herzel, chief executive of the Brothers in Arms protest movement.

On Wednesday thousands packed streets close to Netanyahu’s official residence in central Jerusalem. Many carried Israeli flags and placards with slogans in support of hostages still held in Gaza. Others beat drums and chanted “hostages deal now” as they marched in from other parts of Israel.

Ora Nakash Peled, a former senior naval officer and an organiser of the protests, had come from her home on a kibbutz near the northern city of Haifa. She had spent the night with other protesters in a tented camp on the outskirts of Jerusalem before walking into the city along a major highway.

“I think we have made our point … We need to be organised, we need to be persistent, we need to be focused. [The protest] cannot be violent [but] it doesn’t have to be polite.”

Protesters chanted: “Israel is not Turkey, Israel is not Iran,” and pointed to a series of recent moves by Netanyahu they call “red flags” for Israeli democracy.

One is the unprecedented effort to dismiss Bar. Another is a bid by the prime minister and his allies to oust the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, who has argued that removing Bar from his post might be unlawful.

“The government has the authority to fire Bar but still has to comply with administrative law,” said Dr Amir Fuchs, a legal expert at the Israel Democracy Institute. “So, for example, if there is seen to be a conflict of interests, it could be stopped by the supreme court.”

Experts point out that Shin Bet, which has wide-ranging powers, is investigating Netanyahu’s close aides for alleged breaches of national security, including leaking classified documents to foreign media and taking money from Qatar, which is know to have given significant financial aid to Hamas. New suspects in the “Qatargate” affair were interviewed by Israeli police on Wednesday, local media reported.

Netanyahu is also facing a potential jail sentence at the conclusion of an ongoing corruption trial. The 75-year-old politician, who took power in Israel for the first time in 1996 and has served 17 years as prime minister, is giving evidence twice weekly.

Other concerns for protesters include reforms that would introduce more political appointees to committees that select judges.

A series of high-ranking officials seen as responsible for the mistakes and misjudgements that led to the Hamas attack in October 2023 have resigned. Netanyahu himself has not accepted any responsibility for Israel’s worst ever security disaster, in which 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed, and has resisted calls for a powerful commission of inquiry.

Fuchs said:“Netanyahu is doing this because he has a problem he wants to solve by centralising as much power as possible and getting rid of all the gatekeepers and professionals … but this does not align with the interests of the state of Israel, only with those of the prime minister and his government.”

Netanyahu claimed there was a “leftist deep state” working against him in a social media post on Wednesday.

“In America and in Israel, when a strong rightwing leader wins an election, the leftist deep state weaponises the justice system to thwart the people’s will. They won’t win in either place!” the post said.

Observers pointed to a strong echo in the current movement of the huge protests that erupted in 2023 when Netanyahu attempted to sack the then defence minister, Yoav Gallant, over his opposition to a planned judicial overhaul.

Opinion polls suggest Netanyahu would lose an election if one were held now, but he is likely to defy the protests, which are smaller than those two years ago, and ignore calls for new polls. A crucial budget vote before the end of the month now looks likely to go in the government’s favour.

The return of Itamar Ben-Gvir, an extreme rightwing politician, to the government after he walked out over the ceasefire deal signed in January has underlined the continuing and vital support for Netanyahu from the nationalist-religious camp in Israel.

Analysts said previously fragmented opposition groups had been brought together in recent days, though there are still no political leaders who look likely to threaten Netanyahu.

“It’s a very strong homogeneous [governing] coalition. It has a solid base and it is hard to see it falling apart. There is still no alternative or vision to Netanyahu being put forward,” said Mairav Zonszein, an expert on Israeli society and politics at the International Crisis Group.

Though protesters say they back a ceasefire now to ensure the return of the hostages, most reflect broader Israeli public opinion and believe the war in Gaza is necessary to eliminate any threat from Hamas.

Zonszein said the demonstrations could not be described as “anti-war”.

“It is not about what is happening in Gaza at all. It is not about civilian casualties there … It is focused on the hostages and the lack of trust in the government.”",,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/20/thousands-protest-in-israel-over-attack-on-democracy-by-netanyahu,,,us,,news,,,,,,2,12,,5,,,theguardian.com,,,,,,,,negative,0.949122428894043

The area around the strait in the past has seen Iran seize commercial ships and launch suspected attacks in the time since President Donald Trump first unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers. 

The drill marked the fifth year the three countries took part in the drills. 

This year’s drill likely sparked a warning late Monday from the British military’s United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center, which said there was GPS interference in the strait, with disruptions lasting for several hours and forcing crews to rely on backup navigation methods.

“This was likely GPS jamming to reduce the targeting capability of drones and missiles,” wrote Shaun Robertson, an intelligence analyst at the EOS Risk Group. “However, electronic navigation system interference has been reported in this region previously during periods of increased tension and military exercises.”

Russia's Defense Ministry identified the vessels it sent to the drill as the corvettes Rezky and the Hero of the Russian Federation Aldar Tsydenzhapov, as well as the tanker Pechenega. China's Defense Ministry said it sent the guided-missile destroyer Baotou and the comprehensive supply ship Gaoyouhu. Neither offered a count of the personnel involved. 

Neither China nor Russia actively patrol the wider Middle East, whose waterways remain crucial for global energy supplies. Instead they broadly cede that to Western nations largely led by the U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet. Observers for the drill included Azerbaijan, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates — with the Americans likely keeping watch as well. 

However, both China and Russia have deep interests in Iran. For China, it has continued to purchase Iranian crude oil despite facing Western sanctions, likely at a discount compared to global prices. Beijing also remains one of the top markets for Iranian imports. 

Russia, meanwhile, has relied on Iran for the supply of bomb-carrying drones it uses in its war on Ukraine. 

The drills marked a major moment for Iran's state-run television network. It's aired segments showing live-fire during a night drill and sailors manning deck guns on a vessel. The exercises come after an Iranian monthslong drill that followed a direct Israeli attack on the country, targeting its air defenses and sites associated with its ballistic missile program. 

While Tehran sought to downplay the assault, it shook the wider populace and came as a campaign of Israeli assassinations and attacks have decimated Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” — a series of militant groups allied with the Islamic Republic. Syrian President Bashar Assad was also overthrown in December, further weakening Iran's grip on the wider region. 

All the while, Iran has increasingly stockpiled more uranium enriched at near weapons-grade levels, something only done by atomic-armed nations. Tehran has long maintained its program is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb. 

Iran's nuclear program has drawn warnings from both Israel and the U.S. that it won't allow Tehran to obtain a bomb, signalling military action against the program could happen. But just last week, Trump sent a letter to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, seeking a new nuclear deal with Tehran. Iran says it hasn't received any letter, but still issued a flurry of pronouncements over it.

As a shaky ceasefire holds in Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Yemen's Houthi rebels have threatened to resume their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait that connect the two waterways. 

The rebels' secretive leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels off Yemen would resume within four days if aid didn't resume to Gaza. That deadline came and went Tuesday. Though no attacks were reported, that again put shippers on edge. The rebels had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels in their campaign that has also killed four sailors.

It is now typically applied to cooperation between Russia and countries that have supported its war against Ukraine; namely China, Iran and North Korea.Chinese, Iranian and Russian vessels have repeatedly carried out joint drills in the Gulf of Oman in recent years, including in March 2024, and in March 2023.What To KnowChina's Defense Ministry said on Sunday that Beijing, Tehran and Moscow will carry out joint naval exercises this month, dubbed ""Security Belt 2025.""The militaries will perform the drills close to Iran's southeastern port of Chabahar, which looks out onto the Gulf of Oman, China's government said. Beijing's fleet will include at least one destroyer and a supply ship, the defense ministry added.Iranian state media reported on Sunday that representatives from Azerbaijan, South Africa, Oman, and several other countries including Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, would observe the drills.Separately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that he would visit Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's crown prince and prime minister, in the coming days. After this meeting, the Ukrainian leader said, senior Kyiv officials will stay on to meet U.S. representatives on Tuesday.The Ukrainian team includes Andriy Yermak, the head of Zelensky's office; the president's deputy chief, Pavlo Palisa; as well as Andriy Sybiha and Rustem Umerov, Ukraine's foreign and defense ministers.""On our side, we are fully committed to constructive dialogue, and we hope to discuss and agree on the necessary decisions and steps,"" Zelensky said, adding that there are ""realistic proposals"" on the table.Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy to the Middle East, told reporters on Friday that he was ""in discussions to coordinate a meeting with the Ukrainians,"" likely to take place in the Saudi capital of Riyadh or the coastal city of Jeddah.Ukraine, and Kyiv's European allies, have been deeply worried over how U.S.-brokered ceasefire talks with Russia could play out. This was heightened by the extraordinary dressing down Trump and Vice President JD Vance gave Zelensky in his recent Oval Office visit and an apparent rapprochement between the White House and the Kremlin.Trump then stopped all U.S. military aid en route to Ukraine, including supplies waiting just miles from the Ukrainian border, and suspended at least some U.S.-derived intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Keith Kellogg, Trump's envoy for Ukraine and Russia, then said Kyiv had ""brought it on themselves.""Trump said on Friday that the U.S. is ""doing very well with Russia,"" and added that it was ""easier"" for him to work with Moscow than Kyiv.What People Are SayingYermak said on Wednesday that he had spoken with Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and ""agreed on a meeting of our teams in the near future.""What Happens NextThe drills are expected to get underway in the coming days, and it remains to be seen how productive Ukrainian negotiations with the U.S. will be.",,https://www.newsweek.com/russia-iran-china-naval-drills-gulf-oman-ukraine-ceasefire-talks-saudi-arabia-2041824,,,us,,news,,,,,,6,9,,12,,,newsweek.com,,,,,,,,negative,0.8355088829994202
News,us,post,298235804,2025-03-09,"Iran is riven with conflict. Donald Trump’s offer of talks won’t ease it The letter the US president, Donald Trump, says he sent to Iran’s leadership offering to reopen talks on the country’s nuclear programme comes at a point when Iranian domestic politics is at its most unstable for years.

In the past month, the conservative-dominated parliament has asserted its power over the broadly reformist president elected last June by impeaching and sacking the experienced economy minister, Abdolnaser Hemmati, while Mohammad Javad Zarif, the vice-president and most prominent reformist, has also been forced out.

Both power plays were clearly made against the wishes of the president, Masoud Pezeshkian, but with the economy reeling under the pressure of US economic sanctions, the 85-year-old supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, has clearly decided against rescuing Pezeshkian.

The parliament, feeling it is on a roll, is now summoning a further group of 11 ministers to ask them 49 questions about their performance in what looks like an attempt to harass Pezeshkian’s government into further submission.

Rumours that Pezeshkian, an emotional man who sets store by integrity, will soon resign have been rife. His departure would confirm that the deep state, or what some in Iran call the shadow government, will not tolerate a loss of power.

If he does go, he has made it clear whom he would hold responsible. In a remarkably candid speech, he finally asserted himself, saying he had favoured negotiations with the west, but the supreme leader had rejected them, so “it’s over and done”.

“My position has been and will remain that I believe in negotiations, but now we have to follow the parameters set by the supreme leader,” Pezeshkian said. “When the supreme leader sets a direction, we must adapt ourselves to it. In order to adapt, we must try to find a way.

“From the day we took over the government, we were confronted with deficiencies in energy, water and power, and on the other hand extreme debts on payments to the agriculture sector for wheat, the health and medical sector, and retirement salaries and so on.”

Similarly, he said his efforts to relieve women of the pressure to wear the hijab had been constantly challenged. On Saturday he issued a further apology over the lack of energy supplies.

A lot of this manoeuvring, ostensibly about economic mismanagement and poverty, is in reality a broader battle over relations with the west, with the conservatives convinced that experience shows Trump and Israel, his ally, are not just untrustworthy, but bent on regime change in Iran.

Pezeshkian had argued in the election that Iran could end its confrontation with the west and still remain independent.

If Trump’s letter has now set onerous conditions for talks on Iran’s nuclear programme, the conservatives will feel vindicated in saying the price Washington demands is too high. But if Tehran rejects Trump’s approach, Israeli bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites then becomes more imminent.

The biggest constraint on such an attack may not be Iran’s many threats of reprisals – Israel thinks it has destroyed Tehran’s air defences – but from the arguments of the Gulf states. The level-headed prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, gave a chilling interview to Tucker Carlson warning that if Iran’s Bushehr nuclear power plant were attacked and radioactive material seeped into the Gulf, within three days none of the countries in the region would have drinking water. They all depend on desalination for their water supply. Not just fish but life in the region would be destroyed, he said.

So far, Iran’s professional diplomats have held the line by saying they will not negotiate with America directly. This keeps open the possibility of indirect talks mediated by Russia, a variation on the wearisome form of negotiations staged in Vienna under the Biden administration that failed to revive the 2015 nuclear deal. The offer might buy Iran some time.

The consensus inside Iran is that Trump’s letter is timed as a piece of psychological warfare designed to force Tehran into rejection, deepening Iranian divisions about its strategy, and taking the crisis between the west and Iran to the final, -climactic, level.",,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/mar/09/iran-is-riven-with-conflict-donald-trumps-offer-of-talks-wont-ease-it,,,us,,news,,,,,,3,8,,11,,,theguardian.com,,,,,,,,negative,0.9986623525619507
News,us,post,297686710,2025-03-07,"Could 'King' Trump's Royal Ties Help Win Him Peace in the Middle East? President Donald Trump's credentials as ""king"" may be up for debate following a controversial White House reference last month, but the U.S. leader's ties to real-life monarchies in the Middle East may prove consequential in his quest to achieve peace in the region.Now, as Arab leaders regroup from White House criticism of their latest plan to pave a new postwar path for the Gaza Strip, a moment of truth has dawned for the warm relationships Trump has long enjoyed with some of the wealthiest and most influential powers in the region, such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.And while the six-state Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) continues to oppose Trump's vision to expel Palestinians and redevelop their conflict-ravaged territory into a premium resort destination, regional experts argue that the only sustainable course ultimately runs through Washington.""The United States, as a global superpower, holds a significant and undeniable role in shaping international diplomacy and conflict resolution,"" Ali Rashid Al Nuaimi, chair of the Hedayah counterterrorism think tank and the Defense Commission of the UAE Federal National Council's Internal and External Relations Committee, told Newsweek. ""It is a reality of the world order that no serious peace initiative can afford to overlook.""""The current global system is built on the engagement of powerful nations, and the U.S. remains a central pillar within that structure,"" he said. ""Whether one agrees with its policies or not, its influence in global affairs is an established fact—one that must be acknowledged, respected, and strategically navigated.""He argued that a sustainable path forward would have to take into account the region's ""intimate understanding of the roots of the conflict and the complexities that shape its trajectory,"" while also recognizing the definitive sway the U.S. holds.""Any sustainable peace plan must be informed by this local expertise while also recognizing that, without U.S. engagement, no initiative can gain the necessary traction to succeed,"" Al Nuaimi said. ""Even the most well-conceived regional plan would struggle to be effective without broader international backing.""The Return of the 'King'Trump has previously demonstrated his ability to break through diplomatic impasses in the region. Months after the rollout of his failed ""peace to prosperity"" plan to reconcile the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the final year of his first term, the U.S. leader successfully brokered the Abraham Accords that resulted in the UAE and Bahrain normalizing ties with Israel in August 2020, with Sudan and Morocco later following suit.Egypt and Jordan are the only other two Arab states to have forged formal relations with Israel, having established treaties in 1979 and 1994, respectively.The landmark Abraham Accords, however, were predicated on the prospects for a new push for peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The initiative never materialized as President Joe Biden emerged victorious in a contentious election that took place shortly after.U.S. relations with the GCC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, cooled under the Biden administration, which clashed with Riyadh over human rights and oil production. Meanwhile, Israeli-Palestinian violence hit record levels, culminating in the October 2023 Hamas-led surprise attack on Israel that triggered the still-ongoing war.As the conflict raged on, Biden outlined the three-phase agreement that stands today as the basis for the current ceasefire terms, but it was Trump who took credit for the deal after it was ultimately signed just days before he took office in January. In a seemingly unprecedented fashion, the incoming administration deployed its negotiators, with Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff at the helm, to work alongside Biden's team in a move viewed by many as decisive in bringing the long-deadlocked talks across the finish line.Trump's return was met with cautious optimism across much of the Arabian Peninsula, where his realist, transactional style of diplomacy has earned him respect.According to Faisal al-Shammari, a Saudi writer and political analyst, ""Trump has a record that differs from previous American administrations, as he relied on the practical approach in dealing with the Kingdom, avoiding the ideological discourse that characterized some previous administrations.""""What distinguishes Trump is his awareness of the importance of stability in the region, and his being more realistic in recognizing the Saudi role as a pivotal power not only in the Arab world, but also on the international scene,"" Shammari told Newsweek. ""This pragmatic approach contributed to the creation of opportunities for cooperation based on mutual interests, which requires strengthening through state institutions and not just personal relationships.""Riyadh at the CrossroadsSaudi Arabia has indeed emerged as an increasingly influential player on the world stage. While the kingdom has long wielded a unique status given the ruling House of Saud's custodianship over the two holiest sites in Islam and vast oil reserves, its rapidly growing economy, increasingly modern outlook and other sweeping changes under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ""Vision 2030"" project have propelled the nation toward middle power status.Like Trump, however, Saudi leadership sees its partnerships, even one as deep-rooted as its World War II-era pact with the U.S., as viable only as long as they were mutually beneficial.""The relationship between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United States is historic, but not unconditional,"" Shammari said. ""The cooperation between Riyadh and Washington will always be based on the realization of mutual interests, and not according to prior assumptions that any American president is able alone to determine the course of this relationship.""Trump is now testing this premise through his incendiary restructuring of the traditional U.S. approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, an issue that continues to ignite tempers throughout the Arab world.With the White House now advertising a strategy that may once and for all decimate the waning support for a two-state solution, Shammari asserted that ""the Gulf Cooperation Council has tools of pressure and influence that it can use to find a more balanced solution, especially by strengthening the paths of economic development in the West Bank, and working to ensure the stability of Gaza away from agendas that deepen the crises instead of solving them.""Yet it's not only Trump's fixation on Gaza's real estate potential that stands in the way of Arab attempts to preserve a path to Palestinian sovereignty. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has declared both Hamas and the West Bank-based Palestinian National Authority unfit to govern Gaza, and the Israeli Foreign Ministry also dismissed the Arab proposal of establishing an interim, independent Palestinian committee to lead the territory as insufficient in addressing Israeli security concerns.Moreover, the Arab League-endorsed plan did not directly reference Hamas once in its 106 pages.Azam al-Shdadi, a Saudi foreign affairs expert and member of the Kingston University Political Science Association, referred to Hamas as ""one of the most prominent"" challenges to realizing a two-state solution, and an issue that the GCC understands it must address.""The events of October 7 have exacerbated the political and security situation, harmed the Palestinian cause, led to the deaths of many innocent victims, and made the international position towards the Palestinian cause more complicated,"" Shdadi told Newsweek. ""The Gulf states, led by Saudi Arabia, realize that addressing this issue requires Palestinian unity and clear, non-extreme demands that can be implemented on the ground.""'The New Europe'The stakes of the U.S.-GCC relationship today extend beyond the Middle East. Saudi Arabia has emerged as a central hub for the Trump administration's talks with both sides of the Russia-Ukraine war, while Qatar and the UAE have also played outsized diplomatic roles in the conflict, negotiating the successful exchanges of displaced children and prisoners between Moscow and Kyiv.At a time when U.S. ties with European allies were in crisis over the Trump administration's pivot from confronting the Kremlin to securing peace, the White House may find more willing partners in ""the new Europe,"" as Crown Prince Mohammed has described his vision for the Middle East.""These efforts contribute to supporting the positive American strategy, as Saudi Arabia is becoming a major global mediator in major international issues,"" Shdadi said, ""from the Iranian nuclear agreement to U.S.-China relations.""Despite its historic proximity to Washington, the GCC has enthusiastically bolstered bonds with Beijing, viewing the People's Republic as a vital economic partner. And while wary of Tehran's regional ambitions, Riyadh and others have reopened channels with the Islamic Republic in recent years in a bid to de-escalate.Trump has traditionally taken on a hard line on China and Iran, though he has signaled a desire to strike deals on both fronts in his second administration. As hints of his policies surface, the royals of the Arabian Peninsula are eager to avoid any major confrontations that could swiftly shatter the island of stability that has allowed them to rapidly progress.Shdadi noted that that the price of failure to prevent such conflagrations could be high for the great powers as well, including the U.S.""If the negotiations fail,"" Shdadi said, ""the United States may face major economic challenges, such as the possibility of the American economy entering a phase of inflation and then economic recession, especially with President Trump activating tariffs, which make it difficult to control global markets, and the increasing international trend towards reducing dependence on the dollar, which may increase pressure on Washington economically and geopolitically.""As for Riyadh, Shdadi argued that Saudi Arabia could also recalibrate its strategy in the event that""Neutrality and bringing viewpoints closer together is the most prominent role,"" he said, ""but Saudi Arabia has strategic relations with China, Russia and the European Union and may be more open, as the Kingdom is a major player capable of adapting to any changes in the international scene, and the period of President Biden was the greatest evidence of this",,https://www.newsweek.com/could-king-trumps-royal-ties-help-win-him-peace-middle-east-2040968,,,us,,news,,,,,,7,6,,3,,,newsweek.com,,,,,,,,positive,0.9982536435127258
News,US,post,295267186,2025-02-28,"Trump's Resort Mentality Pushes Middle East to Rethink Failed Strategies As President Donald Trump embarks on a massive shake-up of traditional U.S. policy at home and abroad, his controversial plans for the Middle East envision a new order in which stakeholders will put aside their complex conflicts and prioritize peace in pursuit of economic prosperity.The explicitly transactional approach, built upon the failures of past U.S. strategies to achieve lasting peace in the region, has drawn significant backlash from all sides.Trump's proposal of transforming the war-torn Gaza Strip into a resort-laden ""Riviera of the Middle East"" while transferring its roughly two million Palestinian residents to ""beautiful communities"" elsewhere has riled Arab leaders, who have scrambled to come up with their own plans. His offer to purse a ""Verifiable Nuclear Peace Treaty"" with Iran that would allow the Islamic Republic to ""peacefully grow and prosper"" has been met with skepticism from hawkish voices in Israel and in Washington.The extent to which the White House is committed to either of these plans—or whether they constitute starting points for further negotiations—remains to be seen, but Trump has repeatedly demonstrated his willingness to adopt disruptive approaches with friends and foes alike.The strategy is reinforced by the former real estate mogul's distinct persona. While often divisive, his business-first approach has won him close ties to both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also referred to by his nickname ""Bibi,"" and Arab royals, including the leaders of Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.""He has a very unique ability to maintain relationships and bring people closer together,"" Jason Greenblatt, former White House envoy to the Middle East during the first Trump administration, told Newsweek. ""That doesn't mean he's going to solve the problem. But he has an added edge, because he gets along with all of them, because they respect him and to some degree are nervous about his methods, and because he's such an out-of-the-box thinker, which, in the case of the Gaza plan, obviously excited Bibi and angered Palestinians, Saudi Arabia and others.""""But in general, everybody understands he's right in saying, 'Hey guys, nothing, absolutely nothing has worked. We have got to figure this out,'"" Greenblatt said. ""So, he brings that healthy dose of ugly reality to the table. I think he is truly a historic figure.""He quipped, ""You know what they say: If everybody's mad at you, you know you're doing something right.""'A Fixer of Problems'Trump previously attempted to pursue a ""Peace to Prosperity"" plan for Israelis and Palestinians during his first term in office.The proposal, widely branded the ""deal of the century,"" would have seen Palestinians granted limited and conditional self-rule in Gaza and parts of the West Bank, with a capital on the outskirts of Jerusalem, while receiving billions in funds for development. Israel, which already considers Jerusalem as its capital, would assume further control of the West Bank and retain broad jurisdiction over Palestinian security and diplomatic affairs.The agreement was immediately rejected by both Hamas and the Palestinian National Authority (PA), along with much of the Arab world, which had little say on the proposal prior to its announcement in January 2020. Trump, too, later reportedly soured on the deal after a spat with Netanyahu over the Israeli premier's plans to immediately annex portions of the West Bank.Trump would, however, manage to score a major Middle East victory later that same year in the Abraham Accords. The deal ultimately saw the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco normalize ties with Israel, defying a longstanding Arab embargo and emboldening Trump to double down in pursuit of even further-reaching arrangements.""One of his major themes is, 'Guys, we've tried a million things in the past. Nobody has succeeded, and nobody's coming up with a better answer. Do you want Palestinians to live in Gaza, suffering for years and years, living in tents? I mean, what do you want to do?'"" Greenblatt, who worked on Trump's Israeli-Palestinian ""Peace to Prosperity"" plan and the Abraham Accords, said.""This is the way you get it done. It's very direct and very pragmatic,"" he added. ""Even if people are uncomfortable with the idea, maybe this idea in its whole doesn't work, but there are other ways to try to fix things. And he's very much a fixer of problems.""'A New Approach to a Petrified Situation'Mohammed Baharoon, director general of the Dubai Public Policy Research Center, told Newsweek that the Abraham Accords ""were not a peace treaty in the conventional sense,"" but rather ""an investment in statehood of Israel (used to be called a Zionist entity) and of Palestine (preventing annexation was an investment in the territorial integrity of the state of Palestine).""""It did provide a prototype of what peace with the region could mean to Israel,"" Baharoon said. ""However, that was only a down payment, a show of confidence, and an enabler. It can't happen without an Israeli investment in the statehood of Palestine.""When it comes to the president's calculus this time around, Baharoon said that ""Donald Trump is right in thinking that he needs a new approach to a petrified situation.""And even if Trump's talk of removing Palestinians from Gaza did not constitute a ""real plan,"" Baharoon said, it succeeded in doing ""what he wanted it to do,"" which was ""to make other countries in the region to take charge of providing solutions.""""His approach is genuine if you address the issue as a real estate development or even as a natural disaster relief,"" Baharoon said. ""This is what happened to people in San Francisco during the earthquake of 1906 and Tokyo after the 1923 Kanto earthquake.""""But what it didn't calculate was the political and identity aspect of a 77-year-old-struggle,"" he added. ""However, I think his MAGA doctrine can benefit a lot for a resolution to a conflict that evaded 12 presidents before him.""Trump himself has walked back from the idea of a compulsory expulsion of Palestinians, clarifying during an interview with Fox News Radio last week that he would not ""force"" this solution, but rather ""sit back and recommend it.""Meanwhile, his words appear to have already motivated Arab leaders toward coming up with an alternative solution as leaders from Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE met that same day in Riyadh to discuss the matter. A final proposal is reportedly forthcoming, potentially at the emergency Arab League summit to be held in Cairo on March 4.But Trump should also not underestimate the resolve with which Arab nations may respond to his brazen attempt to sideline Palestinian agency, argued Anna Jacobs, a fellow at the Gulf States Institute.""Both sides will have to make compromises, but Trump's plan is essentially giving Israel's far right everything they want and completely ignoring Palestinian demands,"" Jacobs told Newsweek. ""Trump's plan does nothing to resolve this conflict. Instead, it is attempting to erase Palestinians from the picture entirely.""After all, it may take more than just convincing the heads of Arab countries. Pro-Palestinian sentiments still run strong among the peoples of the region, and history has proven how civil unrest can quickly lead to instability even in nominally stable nations.""Many Arab countries may not be democracies, but they do pay attention to public opinion, especially on the Palestinian issue,"" she said. ""It is a hugely sensitive and important issue across the Arab and Islamic worlds. After the October 7 terrorist attack on Israel and the subsequent deadly war on Gaza, the Palestinian issue cannot be ignored in negotiations about Arab-Israeli normalization, period.""Debates in Washington and TehranNavigating successful diplomacy with Iran is in some ways an even more precarious task. The enmity between Washington and Tehran stems back decades, but with Trump it's personal.Shortly before he unveiled the so-called ""deal of the century"" alongside Netanyahu in early 2020, the U.S. leader ordered the killing of Iran's revered Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force commander, Major General Qassem Soleimani, amid already heightened tensions over Trump's decision to abandon a multilateral nuclear deal with the Islamic Republic. Iranian officials have since demanded Trump be arrested and brought to trial over the slaying.Iran has been linked by U.S. officials to several assassination plots against Trump, not including the two notable attempts on his life during the campaign trail. Tehran has consistently denied any role in such operations.Iran has also consistently denied seeking weapons of mass destruction, yet the Islamic Republic's accelerating nuclear program continues to serve as a major flashpoint in the Middle East. Some Israeli officials have openly called for the U.S. to pursue military action against the Islamic Republic's nuclear infrastructure, particularly after Iran and Israel engaged in two series of direct strikes throughout the war in Gaza.Trump has downplayed his enthusiasm for a U.S. attack on Iran, however, instead advertising his interest in mutually beneficial deal that would ensure Tehran could never obtain a nuclear weapon.Jonathan Panikoff, director of the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, described the approach as somewhat ""ironic"" since it was Trump who abandoned the previous agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), in the first place. The shift may not only draw anger from Israel's emboldened far right but also aggravate divisions within Trump's own administration between an old conservative guard seeking a more assertive posture on Iran and the rising cadre of Trump loyalists who more closely share the president's vision.""I think there's something to be said for reassessing the U.S. approach to the region, but this doesn't seem to be a strategy, it seems to reflect primarily the president's ideas but also internal disagreements I imagine will get bigger,"" Panikoff, who previously served as deputy national intelligence officer for the Near East at the U.S. National Intelligence Council, told Newsweek. ""The first term was largely all neocons and hawks but now there's a much bigger split with isolationists and the strategy and ultimate goals don't align between them.""Meanwhile, the interim return to the first Trump administration's ""maximum pressure"" approach may ultimately serve to alienate rather than entice Iran toward renewed talks.Tehran's early hesitance was evidenced by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stating earlier this month that negotiations at the U.S. at this time would not be ""rational, intelligent, or honorable."" Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi more recently emphasized that ""there is no possibility of direct negotiations"" under Trump's intensified sanctions regime.Following his meeting with Russian Foreign Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday, however, Araghchi also spoke of ongoing consultations on the issue with China and Russia, which, utilizing its newly minted strategic partnership with Iran and rapidly improving relations with the U.S., may be poised to influence Tehran toward nuclear talks.Panikoff noted that ""Iran is not monolithic within its system and it would be a mistake to think there is not policy debate—there is, far more than in many Arab countries,"" particularly with reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian having openly promoted a pro-JCPOA campaign promising to improve Iran's dire economic outlook.""At the end of the day, Pezeshkian can only operate within the bounds the supreme leader sets and execute the policy he ultimately decides on,"" Panikoff said. ""The supreme leader believes the U.S. was dishonest and broke an agreement and doesn't trust entering into a new dialogue now is worthwhile because Washington won't uphold it ultimately.""At the same, he argued, ""it's possible there could be private, behind-the-scenes efforts through Track 1.5's to keep alive the potential for a new deal.""Devils in the DetailsObservers and former officials have previously told Newsweek that both sides had conveyed quiet signals regarding the prospects of U.S.-Iran diplomacy in the leadup to Trump taking office. Qatar, which played a pivotal role in mediating the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, has also expressed its willingness to support Trump in pursuing broader regional diplomacy.But as Panikoff argued that a streamlined deal focused solely on the nuclear file and putting aside other concerns such as Iran's missile program and aid to ""Axis of Resistance"" militias may raise concerns for Arab partners, others argue that the key to a successful deal may lie in its simplicity.""One prerequisite for success, namely, you don't go for a very elaborate deal,"" Ariel Levite, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace's Nuclear Policy Program and Technology and International Affairs Program, told Newsweek. ""You don't spend time, years, negotiating it, you are willing to have to exercise a lot of pressure, and you are willing to settle for less.""Levite, who previously served as the principal deputy director general for policy at the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission and deputy national adviser for defense policy, argued that, ""if there would be an elaborate deal, [Khamenei] would ask for endless conditions which the U.S. will never be able to accept, and that is also not Trump's negotiating style.""Given Khamenei's public hesitance toward reentering talks with Washington, Levite suggested that the talks would be best carried out by intermediaries. And he argued ""the timing is right"" to do so.'Shock Therapy'On both the issues of Gaza and Iran, Levite described Trump's approach as a form of ""shock therapy,"" one in which there were ""incredible risks and great opportunities.""""Shock because part of it is from audacity, some of it from disregard to earlier attempts and those who tried them, some of it from ignorance and some of it from kind of a general sense that other stuff had been tried and failed. So why not rock the boat?"" Levite said. ""You shock people into actually getting off the seat that they have long been perched on, either to accept or to offer something in its stead.""But part of the inherent pitfalls in this new trajectory for U.S. policy lies in its extremely personalized nature, one whose success or failure may lie primarily in the ability—or inability—for leaders to read Trump himself. Levite felt that, for example, Netanyahu had potentially read too far into Trump's willingness to threaten Iran and expel Palestinians from Gaza following their latest meeting in Washington earlier this month.""Is [Trump], for example, truly enamored with the resettlement and development of a Palestinian-free Gaza, or is he just using it to force others to come up with a better or at least more viable option?"" Levite said, ""same for reading what his end game is on Iran and how Trump would treat a military option to set back its nuclear program by Israel and/or the U.S. It is a very complicated and charged issue.""The other challenge Levite highlighted was that such an endeavor demands major commitments from a team of skilled diplomats dedicated to the issue at a time when Trump was also pursuing a number of other high-profile talks. Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, has earned Trump's trust as an adept negotiator given his breakthrough on the Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza but he has also been tapped to play a role in putting an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, potentially limiting his bandwidth.""I think Steve Witkoff indeed excelled in that situation,"" Levite said. ""Now we need to come forward with something that is really from scratch, and the sensitivities and the complications and the risks are enormous.""""By the way,"" he added, ""so are they if the whole thing is left unattended.""",,https://www.newsweek.com/trump-resort-mentality-middle-east-strategies-2036216,,,us,,news,,,,,,3,5,,11,,,newsweek.com,,,,,,,,negative,0.937633216381073
News,gb,post,304914622,2025-03-27,"Iran says it has responded to Trump's nuclear talks letter Iran has sent a response to a letter from US President Donald Trump that called for nuclear talks and warned of possible military action if it refuses, its foreign minister said Thursday.

""This official response includes a letter in which our position regarding the current situation and Mr Trump's letter has been fully explained to the other party,"" Abbas Araghchi told the official IRNA news agency.

He added that the letter was delivered to Oman, which has served as an intermediary in the past in the absence of US-Iranian diplomatic relations.

He did not disclose the nature of the response or say when it had been sent.

Trump, who in 2018 pulled the United States out of an agreement to relieve sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme, now says he is open to diplomatic talks.

The US president revealed at the start of March that he had sent a letter to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

At the same time, Trump has pushed ahead with his ""maximum pressure"" programme of additional sanctions on Tehran and the threat of military action if it refuses to negotiate.

""Our policy remains not to negotiate directly (with Washington) under 'maximum pressure' and the threat of military action, but indirect negotiations, such as those that took place in the past, can continue,"" Araghchi said.

- Intermediaries -

Iran and the United States have not had official diplomatic relations since 1980.

However, the two countries have engaged indirectly via the Swiss embassy in Tehran, which represents US interests in Iran.

Oman has also played the role of mediator in the past, as has Qatar, to a lesser extent.

Trump's letter was delivered to Iran by the United Arab Emirates.

Iran agreed to the deal curbing its nuclear programme in 2015 after negotiations with major powers including the United States and China.

Western government have for decades suspected that Tehran is pursuing a nuclear weapons capability, a charge that Iran denies, insisting that the programme is solely for civilian purposes.

Iran continued to respect the deal for a year after Trump pulled out, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, before rolling back its commitments.

The US decision to withdraw was driven in part by Iran's ballistic missile programme, which was not covered by the deal and which Washington perceived as a threat.

News,gb,post,304841462,2025-03-27,"The most important intelligence sharing network in the west is being ruined by America - here’s how Five Eyes, the most important intelligence network in the western world, binds the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand into a tapestry of shared espionage. 

But now it is unravelling – and the Trump administration has pulled its threads. 

Mark Carney, the new Canadian Prime Minister, said that his country may now have to “look to ourselves” following the revelations that US defence secretary Pete Hegseth shared sensitive details of plans to attack Yemen’s Houthis on a Signal messaging group which included the head of the CIA and the US director of national intelligence – and a journalist.

“We have a very strong intelligence partnership with the Americans through Five Eyes,” Carney said. “Mistakes do happen, but what’s important is how people react to those mistakes. They don’t deny the mistakes; that they are clear and transparent in addressing them.”

But every US official on the Signal group, including the head of the CIA and the director of National Intelligence, has denied there was a security breach, insisted that no secret material was shared, and brushed the whole incident off.

This has had a catastrophic effect on the faith of US-allied intelligence services in the ability of American officials to keep the most secret secrets secret. 

Most importantly because it is clear that a personal phone identified as most likely in the hands of Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff, was receiving sensitive information about US military plans while he was in Moscow.

Using a commercial messaging system rather than a government-encrypted communications system is dumb enough. Doing so using personal telephones is unforgivable. Doing both in Moscow, as it would appear Witkoff did, is downright incompetent.

As an example of the reach of Russian intelligence into mobile devices, I used an Apple device during a recent two-week trip to Ukraine which ended in Odesa, the Ukrainian port city last Saturday. Yesterday I fired that device up and found all its data traffic was being routed through Russian Sevastopol, in Russian-occupied Crimea.

When British government delegations traveled to the Russian capital, personal and government-issued mobile phones of every single member of the delegation, the air crew, and security personnel were left in the UK. That order included the prime minister.

On arrival, the delegations were issued new phones for local use. They also get trained in minimizing all communications and how to behave while in country, including while in the toilet and in bed. On departure, the phones they were issued to use in Moscow were always smashed before takeoff, the debris brought back to the UK and burned.

Witkoff has, allegedly, been wandering Moscow with his personal phone oblivious to the fact that Russian intelligence will have penetrated his handset. 

They will have done this as easily as the Saudi Arabians, and the other Gulf countries he has also visited. Every resident in Saudi or the UAE is famously aware that their communications are so bugged they can sometimes hear recordings of themselves mid-chat.

US-allied intelligence agencies will now be scrambling to try to figure out what secrets of theirs Witkoff may have stored on his phone.

“What other communications have been going on between the heads of US intelligence agencies on their personal phones over Signal? It’s not just the content of the messages that’s worrying it’s that we now don’t know if their handsets themselves are even secure,” said a Middle Eastern intelligence official.

Witkoff has been at the centre of talks between Hamas and Israel in Qatar, and between Ukraine and Russia, in Saudi Arabia.

 Any kind of a leak from the US side would be a catastrophic compromise. Europe now knows for sure, after the Signal message snafu, that both Pete Hegseth and JD Vance have contempt for the entire European continent.

The Signal chat group revealed by The Atlantic when the magazine’s editor-in-chief was accidentally added to a group discussing the imminent bombardment of the Houthis, and later analysis of the operation, included: Vance, Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, “MAR,” the initials of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, “TG,” the initials of director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, “Scott B”, who is likely to be Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent “S M,” the initials of the White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, Susie Wiles, White House chief of staff and Witkoff, special envoy to the Middle East and Russia.

How many of these officials were using their own personal phones is unclear. 

Ratcliffe told the Senate intelligence committee that he used Signal on his CIA office computer. Did he use it on his personal phone for CIA-related conversations? 

Gabbard was vague about where she had been during the Signal chat about Yemen. She said she had been in Asia. She was, in fact, in or near Thailand and landed in India the day after the Yemen attacks.

India is a US ally but not as much as it is of Vladimir Putin’s Russia. India has close ties in defence, nuclear power, space and missile technology with the Kremlin. And like the Russians, India is a world leader in mobile phone technology.

Israeli company NSO led the commercial world with its Pegasus spyware which was able to entirely coopt the personal phones of thousands of people. It has been used in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, India, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda and Hungary.

The truth is that Five Eyes under Donald Trump’s first presidency was already severely strained by what some members of the group saw as dangerous incompetence in handling secrets by the Oval Office. 

At least one other close American ally in the Middle East confirmed that, along with one Five Eye nation, the most sensitive material, details of operations, were being held back from the CIA. The fear was that Trump would blurt secrets in meetings – and get people killed.

The most egregious example of this was when Trump disclosed highly classified information to Russia's foreign minister about a planned Islamic State operation in 2017. 

He blurted out details of an ISIS plot to blow up an airliner with a bomb in a laptop and boasted of other details - which were not even American secrets to reveal. His audience was Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak.

Russia was heavily involved in Syria at the time supporting the regime of Bashar al Assad which was also a target of US intelligence gathering.

Middle Eastern spy agencies went into elaborate contortions to protect the source of the original intelligence, who was identified as working for Israel’s Mossad, because Trump had told the Russians there was an agent inside the Isis leadership.

Intelligence officers in two different organizations told me soon after that debacle that while the CIA was trustworthy they could not risk sharing top secrets with the president of the US.

Five Eyes has been the bedrock of the Anglophone intelligence world for decades. It is a means by which signals intelligence, mostly from Britian’s GCHQ and the US National Security Agency, is shared automatically on a network between the five participating countries. They also liaise very closely on human intelligence, often sharing agents in the field, the data they collect, literally working side by side.

The UK has traditionally had the edge, along with the US, on Russia. Australia and New Zealand closely monitor their regions, Canada has a reputation for exceptional intelligence analysis. 

These countries also work closely with other allies. Israel, the UK and the US have a very close relationship spying on Iran. The Germans are well known to have exceptional reach in the Middle East. And all of them see Russia, and China, as the enduring adversaries and most serious strategic threats.

They will all be horrified that not only were America’s top intelligence officials chatting on Signal but that some of them, perhaps all of them, were using personal phones. Gabbard refused to tell the Senate Intelligence Committee whether, or not, she was using a government-issued secure phone for the chat – or her personal device.

Gabbard is in charge of the National Intelligence Service that hoovers up signals intelligence for the US and liaises directly with GCHQ in the UK. 

Risk averse Five Eyes intelligence agencies will draw only one conclusion from her evasion of the question. She can’t be trusted.",,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/us-signal-intelligence-sharing-five-eyes-b2722663.html,,,uk,,news,,,,,,5,10,,7,,,independent.co.uk,,,,,,,,negative,0.9605110883712769
News,gb,post,303211438,2025-03-23,"JC Israel Briefing Day 534: Mass protests over return to Gaza War This story first appeared as today’s Israel briefing newsletter. You can sign up to receive it daily here. An estimated 100,000 Israelis poured into the streets last night to protest against the government. This is one per cent of Israel’s population – the equivalent of 650,000-person protests in the UK. They were demonstrating against what they view as the government’s neglect of hostages and the administration’s moves against the security and legal establishment, which they alleged are motivated by the Prime Minister’s personal interests. Opposition leader Yair Lapid claimed that the government is “doing everything to start a civil war here”. Back to the protest story shortly, but first the latest in the Gaza conflict. Hamas has announced that Israel killed one of its senior political leaders Salah al-Bardawil. The terror group called his killing a “treacherous Zionist assassination” and hailed him as a “symbol of political, media, and national work,” noting that he “never failed to perform his duties or … jihad.” Since Israel restarted fighting last week it has killed several Hamas leaders, including Gaza’s de-facto Prime Minister Essam Addalees and internal security chief Mahmoud Abu Watfa. The latest Israeli operations also include targeting militant infrastructure and weapons storage sites. Fighter jets struck what the IDF described as a Hamas command centre. As Israel fights, it is doubling down on its insistence that Hamas is eliminated. But the Trump administration has hinted at a different course of action. President Trump’s Middle East point-man has suggested Hamas could remain politically active in Gaza if it disarms. Steve Witkoff said in an interview that if it demilitarises, the group could potentially ""be involved politically” in the Strip’s future. While he said that Hamas can’t continue to be a terrorist organisation and run Gaza, he was open to its continued presence after major reforms and said that he believes the group is less extreme than it is often portrayed. Hamas quickly responded, saying that the call to demilitarise is “meaningless” as long as “the occupation” – a word the terror group uses to refer to Israel – still exists. Elsewhere, Arab mediators are scrambling to salvage the collapsed ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. According to the Washington Post, Egypt and Qatar are pushing for an emergency truce. In related news, there are reports that Hamas is still considering the possibility of accepting a US proposal for an extended ceasefire. Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanoua was quoted in Arab media saying that “the proposal by Witkoff, along with several ideas, is being discussed with mediators.” Now back to the mass protests in Israel. Protestors claim that the government has put the remaining Israeli hostages in danger by choosing to return to fighting instead of negotiating the next phase of the ceasefire deal. They also allege that Prime Minister Netanyahu’s motivation in trying to fire two national officials – Shin Bet Chief Ronen Bar and Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara – is to defend his personal standing. Netanyahu and his supporters argue that restarting the war in Gaza is the best path to solidifying Israel’s security and that the best method of getting the hostages back is by placing Hamas is under military pressure. They also say that the sacking of Bar and Baharav-Miara are in the national interest. At the protests there was alarm over reports that ministers are considering going through with Bar’s dismissal even if a pending High Court petition ends with judges declaring the move illegal. There is growing pressure for a national strike in such a scenario. Opposition leader Yair Lapid told crowds last night that if this happens “the economy needs to strike, the Knesset needs to strike, the courts need to strike, the local authorities need to strike, not only the universities need to strike, but also the schools. If we can organise a tax revolt, we will organise a tax revolt”. He accused the government of misusing a call for “unity” as a means of silencing legitimate criticism, and said: “Silence in the face of a destructive government is not unity.” He claimed that Netanyahu’s policies are sowing division to a point that civil war is a real danger. The demonstrations also saw moving speeches regarding the hostages still in Gaza. The youngest speaker was Amit Nimrodi, the teenage sister of hostage Tamir. She said: “I’m a 15-year-old girl. I don’t understand politics, I just want my brother home. I want to go back to being a child.” Before the main protests Yehuda Cohen, father of hostage soldier Nimrod, spoke outside IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv. He claimed: ""After he blew up the [ceasefire] agreement, Netanyahu is now blowing up the hostages in Gaza."" Last night’s protest took place amid similar fury from families who lost loved ones in the October 7 attacks over the alleged misuse of their names in politics. The names of some victims’ parents appeared in a campaign taking the government’s side on the question of whether there should be a state commission of inquiry into the massacre. The government strongly opposes such a move but some of the families in question are actively campaigning in favour of an inquiry. Amos Baram, father of Ilay Baram, said: “You used my name and my son’s name without my permission. This is a despicable act for which there is no forgiveness.” Meanwhile, Hezbollah fired rockets at Israel from southern Lebanon yesterday, prompting a severe response. The Israeli air force hit a Hezbollah command centre and several rocket launch sites. Residents in northern Israeli communities who are meant to return home have raised deep concerns about the renewed skirmishes. Similarly, Houthi terrorists in Yemen launched a rocket towards Israel yesterday and another this morning. Both were intercepted before reaching Israel. The Houthis have also threatened to target Ben Gurion Airport, writing on social media: “After the success of the Yemeni Armed Forces in severing maritime trade with Israel in the Red Sea, a blockade is imposed on Ben Gurion Airport in occupied Palestine.” And Israel has struck several targets in Syria, including at the Palmyra military airport and the nearby T-4 airbase. The IDF said they targeted the “remaining strategic military capabilities” of the former Assad regime – referring to assets which it fears could be misused by the new Syrian leadership. Back in Gaza, Fatah, Hamas’ main rival in Palestinian politics, has called on the terror group to relinquish control of the Strip. According to AFP, Fatah spokesman Monther al-Hayek said that Hamas should step aside from governing and fully recognise that the battle ahead will lead to the end of Palestinians’ existence"" if it remains in power. Fatah, the party of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, is widely seen as less extreme than Hamas. Finally, Former Shin Bet chief Yoram Cohen warned that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly asked for “things that are illegitimate, possibly illegal.” In an interview with Channel 12, Cohen said such requests were made during his tenure and to others after him. He accused Netanyahu of trying to install loyalists to obstruct investigations, including the ongoing probe into alleged Qatari influence in the Prime Minister’s Office. He added that Netanyahu’s push to remove Ronen Bar was an effort to halt the investigation, saying: “Any future Shin Bet head will operate under the threat of being fired.” You can sign up to the JC’s Israel briefing here.",,https://www.thejc.com/news/israel/jc-israel-briefing-day-534-israel-protests-r02pjt83,,,uk,,news,,,,,,6,4,,10,,,thejc.com,,,,,,,,negative,0.9810596108436584
News,gb,post,301828488,2025-03-19,"Israel Briefing Day 530: Several senior Hamas and Islamic Jihad figures killed in Gaza strikes This story first appeared as today’s Israel briefing newsletter. You can sign up to receive it daily here. The second day of renewed fighting is underway in Gaza, after Israel restarted strikes yesterday – and quickly assassinated some senior militants. Amid international criticism of the operation and its human cost in Gaza, including from British Foreign Secretary David Lammy, the Israeli government is defending the move, saying that it gave Hamas chances to extend the ceasefire and it failed to do so. But families of hostages are dismayed by the move and are ramping up protests. Here are six key points on the new hostilities: 1. Several senior Hamas and Islamic Jihad figures were killed by Israel yesterday. The most important was Essam al-Da’alis, the head of the Hamas government in Gaza and de facto Prime Minister. Israel also killed Hamas Police Minister Mahmoud Abu Watfa. Overnight, Israel hit a Hamas military site in northern Gaza where it said that “preparations were being made to fire projectiles at Israeli territory.” The Israeli Navy hit vessels which it said were “intended to be used for terrorist activities.” 2. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is insisting that military pressure is necessary to force Hamas into further hostage releases. “From now on, negotiations will be conducted only [with Hamas] under fire,” he said yesterday. He stated: “Hamas rejected every proposal, time after time.” Netanyahu argued: “We extended the ceasefire for weeks, hoping Hamas would change course. Well, that didn’t happen. And so, we have returned to fighting with force.” He said that Israel is pursuing the same goals it has had since October 2023: destroying Hamas, securing the hostages’ return, and ensuring Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel. 3. Freed hostages and their families strongly disagree with Netanyahu. “My heart is broken, shattered, and disappointed,” wrote the freed British-Israeli hostage Emily Damari. The high-profile freed captives Yarden Bibas, Noa Argamani, and Keith Siegel accused the government of prioritising military action over hostage rescue. Siegel spoke about his captivity and called for resuming negotiations but did not directly link military action to endangering the hostages. 4. On the right of Israel’s political spectrum, the reaction is starkly different. The resumption of fighting is being applauded, and Itamar Ben Gvir’s far-right Otzma Yehudit party, which left the coalition in protest at the ceasefire, has returned. The cabinet unanimously approved Ben Gvir’s reappointment as National Security Minister and reappointment of two of his colleagues to other ministries. The party’s return strengthens Netanyahu’s majority in the Knesset and strengthens the right flank of the government. 5. Some critics of Netanyahu are claiming that he was motivated by political survival more than national security in renewing fighting. This accusation was heard at a mass anti-government rally yesterday and has also been voiced by Yair Golan, leader of the Democrats party, formerly Labour. At the rally, former Mossad chief Tamir Pardo accused Netanyahu of being a “clear and immediate danger to national security” and leading Israel into “self-destruction” for political reasons. Former police commissioner Roni Alsheich warned that Netanyahu was “harming national security” but did not specify non-state interests. 6. Internationally, the criticism of Israel’s actions and their impact on Gazans has been swift, including from British Foreign Secretary David Lammy. He described the civilian casualties from Israel’s renewed airstrikes in Gaza as “appalling.” He argued: “All parties must re-engage with negotiations to get hostages out, surge aid, and secure a permanent end to this conflict.” Lammy insisted that “diplomacy, not more bloodshed, is how we get security for Israelis and Palestinians.” He also told Parliament yesterday that Israel’s blockade on humanitarian aid to Gaza contravened international law. Downing Street later distanced itself from his remarks, with a spokesperson for Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying that Israel’s actions pose a “clear risk,” but only international courts can assess their legality. In other news... Politicians from the Religious Zionism party are advancing a bill that would tie Israel’s hands in negotiating to free hostages. The proposed legislation would limit the number of terrorists who could be freed in exchange for hostages. Supporters argue it will deter future abductions, but hostage families fear that it could set back chances of freeing their loved ones. There has been a development in the scandal over alleged Qatari influence in Israel. Police and Shin Bet are investigating claims that members of the Prime Minister’s Office were working for Qatar on public relations campaigns. Now, Channel 12 is reporting that an Israeli businessman has confirmed in recorded conversations that he helped transfer money from a Qatari government lobbyist to Eli Feldstein, a spokesperson in the Prime Minister’s Office. Feldstein’s lawyers deny any wrongdoing, insisting he never worked for Qatar, never transferred information to it, and never received money from it.

News,gb,post,301776458,2025-03-19,"In bombing Gaza, Netanyahu has chosen domestic politics over hostages In the early hours of Tuesday, families in Gaza were shaken awake by the return of ferocious bombardment from the air and land. The tense calm of a fragile ceasefire – brokered by the US, Qatar, and Egypt and in place since January – had been shattered. 

Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the renewed offensive, vowing that Israel will “from now on act against Hamas with increasing military strength”, blaming the group for its “repeated refusal to release our hostages, as well as its rejection of all of the proposals”. 

It comes just two weeks after he ordered Israel to cut off all food, medicine, fuel, electricity, and other supplies to Gaza’s two million people to try and put pressure on Hamas to accept a new deal. 

Mr Netanyahu has seemingly refused to bow to pressure from the families of the hostages to continue the truce and bring their loved ones home. 

On Tuesday morning the largest faction representing hostages’ families said their “greatest fear has come true – the Israeli government has chosen to abandon the hostages”. 

They warned that “resuming fighting will cost more hostages their lives”, before saying: “We must stop the fighting and immediately return to the negotiation table.”

Hamas militant group, meanwhile, accused Netanyahu of upending the ceasefire agreement and in a veiled threat, said the fighting exposed the remaining hostages “to an unknown fate”.

So what happened? 

The ceasefire was supposed to consist of three phases, the first of which expired two weeks ago and saw Hamas hand over 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. 

Phase two, which is yet to be fully negotiated, was supposed to pave the way to a long-term ceasefire, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the return of all hostages taken by Hamas in its attack on Israel that started the war in 2023.

However, ending the war and withdrawing from the besieged strip has been fiercely rejected by the extreme-right flank of the Israeli government, including Itamar Ben-Gvir, minister of national security, who resigned in protest when the initial Gaza ceasefire began in January. 

In fact, hardline cabinet members have, at several points, threatened to bring down Mr Netanyahu’s fragile coalition if he does not return to the fighting. 

One concern in Israel is that Mr Netanyahu is more preoccupied with satisfying his far-right partners ahead of a budget vote next week and saving his political skin while he is on trial, than bringing his citizens home and building peace. 

Israeli media reported on Tuesday morning that Ben-Gvir was poised to return to the heart of government, possibly within days. 

As Amir Tibon, a correspondent for left-leaning newspaper Haaretz, put it on X (Twitter): “Netanyahu had a choice” return the hostages to their families or “return Ben-Gvir to the government to pass a budget. And he chose Ben-Gvir.” 

Mr Netanyahu was also due to appear in court on Tuesday to testify in his ongoing corruption trials, which have cast a long shadow over the embattled premier’s terms of office and future. 

The Israeli leader has vehemently denied the charges and portrayed the legal proceedings as a political witch hunt. 

He has frequently, and unsuccessfully, requested that his hearings be cancelled so he can focus on the war in Gaza. His wish was apparently temporarily granted on Tuesday – the latest session has been postponed due to the renewed hostilities.

Another theory in Israel is that the decision to return to war in Gaza is related to fierce criticism Mr Netanyahu has faced over his decision last week to oust his domestic intelligence chief, Ronen Bar. 

Israeli media has reported that he fired Bar to thwart planned investigations into how Hamas’s 2023 attack happened and into Israeli connections with funding streams to the militant group. 

All of this has provided a fraught backdrop to already messy and muddy negotiations for a lasting truce in recent days, with all sides – Hamas, Israel, or Donald Trump’s top negotiator Steve Witkoff –putting forward unsuccessful proposals.

Mr Netanyahu has made it clear that he does not want to move to phase two and instead suggested an extension of phase one which would require Hamas to release half of its remaining hostages – the militant group’s main bargaining chip – in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. 

However, Israel has made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners, a key component of the first phase.

Hamas is adamant phase two must begin but suggested their own temporary proposal, which involved releasing a living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four dual nationals who had died in captivity – but this was also rejected, with Mr Netanyahu calling it “manipulation”. 

Mr Witkoff, a long-time friend of Trump who got the January deal over the line, has reportedly spent multiple hours with Qatari negotiators in Doha in the last week and may have even okayed the first direct talks between US and Hamas officials. He put forward a slightly different “bridge proposal” that apparently has also not been embraced. 

Israel’s renewed offensive has already killed hundreds of civilians in Gaza, with medics saying that the strip’s destroyed healthcare system, crippled by aid blockade, cannot cope with the influx of wounded. 

In Israel, families of hostages fear their loved ones have simply been forgotten and will also perish in the bombardment.

A complete return to war in Gaza could once again trigger regional conflict, dragging in the Houthis in Yemen and the Iranians into the mix – especially after Trump ordered strikes on the Yemeni capital Sana’a and Red Sea region this week.

News,gb,post,299507676,2025-03-12,"Influencing the Middle East the Italian way: MEMO in Conversation with Maria Luisa Fantappie Italy’s fate is deeply entangled with the Middle East and North Africa, the Italian island of Pantelleria is just 35 miles off the Tunsian coast. Whenever tensions flare up in the Middle East and North Africa it triggers public debate in Italy, getting the MENA right is a key national interest for Rome. When Giorgia Meloni became leader of Italy, many wondered how the far-right government would tackle the MENA region differently.

Meloni actively cultivated close ties with Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the Gulf. Italian diplomacy managed to quickly secure the release of detained Italian journalist Cecilia Sala, who was arrested in Iran in December 2024. Rome also sought to change the European Union’s position on engaging with the regime of Bashar Al-Assad in Syria. But, with the collapse of Al-Assad, the lack of Italian diplomatic activity to bring to an end Israel’s war on Gaza and a new Donald Trump administration in the White House, what is Rome’s place with regards MENA policy? Joining us to make sense of all of this is Maria Luisa Fantappiè.

Fantappiè is head of the Mediterranean, Middle East and Africa Programme at Istituto Affari Internazionali (IAI). She served as Special Adviser at the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue in Geneva (2020-2023) and at the International Crisis Group (2012-2020), engaging at the highest level of policy in Europe, the United States and across MENA (Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Qatar, Oman and United Arab Emirates). In 2018, she was seconded by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the European advisory mission for security sector reform in Iraq (EUAM). Her research interests include the MENA region, EU foreign policy and great powers competition in this area, conflict prevention and mediation as well as cultural diplomacy.

News,ae,post,302790954,2025-03-21,"Israel supreme court freezes PM bid to sack intel chief Jerusalem: Israel’s supreme court Friday froze a decision by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to sack the internal security agency chief, an unprecedented move that has deepened divisions in the country.The court’s decision came after opposition parties and a non-governmental organisation filed separate appeals hours after the government announced its decision to sack Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar.Opposition leader Yair Lapid’s centre-right Yesh Atid party said it had appealed against Bar’s dismissal before the Supreme Court of Israel in the name of several opposition movements.Yesh Atid denounced what it called “a decision based on flagrant conflict of interest”.The Movement for Quality Government in Israel also appealed against what it said was “an unlawful decision... posing a real risk to the national security of the State of Israel”.The NGO was previously very active in the fight against a controversial move by Netanyahu to curb the judiciary’s independence.That proposed reform was seen by opponents as a danger to Israeli democracy and the rule of law, and sparked one of the largest protest movements in the country’s history.Friday’s separate legal appeals came hours after the government moved to dismiss Bar, with Netanyahu previously citing an “ongoing lack of trust” in him.The Shin Bet chief’s sacking was to have been effective before April 10. On Friday, he took part in a Gaza situational assessment meeting along with army chief Eyal Zamir, the military said in a statement.It is the first time in Israel’s history that the head of the domestic intelligence agency has been fired.Netanyahu’s office said later on Friday the government would meet on Sunday for a no confidence vote on the attorney general, a vocal critic of the prime minister.“We resolve to express our lack of confidence in the government’s legal adviser, Gali Baharav-Miara, due to her inappropriate behaviour and due to significant and prolonged differences between the government and the government’s legal adviser,” said a cabinet meeting agenda published on the PM office’s website.Thousands of Israelis braved cold and rainy weather on Thursday night in protest at the moves against Bar and Baharav-Miara, demonstrating outside parliament and Netanyahu’s home in Jerusalem. Opposition appealThe opposition appeal was filed in the name of Yesh Atid, the National Union party headed by former defence minister Benny Gantz, the leftist Democrats alliance and nationalist party Yisrael Beiteinu.Their appeal highlights what critics see as the two main reasons why Netanyahu moved against Bar, a Shin Bet veteran who joined the agency in 1993.The first was Bar’s criticism of the government over the security failure that allowed Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel to become the deadliest day in the country’s history.The second was what media dubbed “Qatargate” - an investigation into government members allegedly paid by Qatar to promote its image.The decision to sack Bar came “as Israel’s Security Agency is currently investigating the prime minister’s close associates... on suspicion of receiving money from entities directly linked to and acting on behalf of the State of Qatar”, the opposition appeal read.In a letter made public late on Thursday, Bar described his dismissal as motivated by Netanyahu’s “personal interests”.Friday’s appeal also mentioned that Bar’s dismissal took place after a Shin Bet investigation highlighting, according to the plaintiffs, “that the political leadership bears responsibility for the October 7 disaster”. Fault linesNetanyahu’s decision revived deep divisions within Israel, with many people concerned by what they see as his latest autocratic move.In a video published Thursday, President Isaac Herzog deplored the government’s “controversial moves” that “deepened divisions” while Israel is still at war in the Gaza Strip.A poll by the Channel 12 television network found that 51 percent of Israelis opposed Bar’s sacking, while 32 percent supported it.A plurality of 46 percent says they trust Bar more than Netanyahu.The crisis comes against the backdrop of new Israeli attacks on Gaza since Tuesday and the reintegration into the government of one of Israel’s far-right figures, Itamar Ben Gvir.He had resigned as national security minister in protest against the ceasefire with Hamas that took effect on January 19.“It’s impossible not to be deeply troubled by the harsh reality unfolding before our eyes,” Herzog said on Thursday night.He said it was “unthinkable to resume fighting while still pursuing the sacred mission of bringing our hostages home” from Gaza.",,https://gulfnews.com/world/mena/israel-supreme-court-freezes-pm-bid-to-sack-intel-chief-2-1.500068542,,,uae,,news,,,,,,4,5,,3,,,gulfnews.com,,,,,,,,negative,0.9956509470939636
News,ae,post,300557846,2025-03-15,"ADNEC Group’s 2024 Economic Impact Reaches AED8.5 Billion, Surpassing Previous Records ADNEC Group has achieved a historic milestone by contributing AED8.5 billion to the UAE economy in 2024, surpassing the AED7.4 billion recorded in 2023. This achievement underscores the group’s expanding influence in bolstering economic growth and aligns with the UAE’s strategic goal of fostering a diversified, knowledge-based economy.

Humaid Matar Al Dhaheri, Managing Director and Group CEO of ADNEC Group, remarked that 2024 has been a landmark year, marked by exceptional achievements across all sectors of their business. He credited the sustained support of the UAE’s leadership and the group’s commitment to innovation, sustainability, and excellence as key factors in these accomplishments.

In 2024, ADNEC Group expanded its global footprint by acquiring Royal Catering and the Business Design Centre in London, UK, bringing its total number of venues to four. This strategic move has strengthened its market presence and diversified its portfolio.

Sustainability remained a core focus for ADNEC Group. The group was honored with the Sheikh Hamdan Environmental Award, reflecting its dedication to environmental stewardship. Notably, the ADNEC Centre Abu Dhabi became the first MICE venue in the Middle East to be powered entirely by clean energy from the Emirates Water and Electricity Company , setting a new benchmark for sustainability in the region. Additionally, the launch of TerraTile, an innovative sustainable flooring product made from exhibition waste, demonstrated the group’s commitment to advancing sustainability in the events industry.

The group’s venues, including ADNEC Centre Abu Dhabi, ADNEC Centre Al Ain, and ExCeL London, hosted over 1,000 events in 2024, attracting more than 5.4 million visitors—the highest number in its history. A significant highlight was the completion of the ExCeL London expansion, increasing the venue’s size to 270,000 square meters. ADNEC Centre Abu Dhabi also hosted its largest and most successful editions of flagship events such as the Abu Dhabi International Boat Show , Global Food Week, and the Abu Dhabi International Hunting and Equestrian Exhibition .

Capital Events, the event organizing arm of ADNEC Group, facilitated deals worth over AED10 billion across eight events, solidifying its reputation as a leader in event management. ADNEC Hotels welcomed a record-breaking 1,531,000 guests, while Capital Catering, the group’s Food & Beverage division, delivered 40 million meals across 45 locations and catered to 2,200 weddings and events, including the largest corporate Iftar at ADNEC Centre Abu Dhabi for 8,000 guests.

Capital 360 Event Experiences achieved its most successful year, driven by regional expansion and key project wins in countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Tourism 365, the tourism arm of ADNEC Group, managed 350,000 travelers, generating 250,000 room nights—the highest performance since its establishment.

Twofour54, an ADNEC Group company, expanded its offerings with the launch of two state-of-the-art TV studios at Yas Creative Hub and supported 34 regional and international productions through its Tawasol initiative. The group also exited its investment in ZenHR, delivering a 300% return on investment.

The 2025 editions of the International Defence Exhibition and the Naval Defence and Maritime Security Exhibition , organized by ADNEC Group, concluded successfully under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE. These events marked the largest editions in their history, attracting 1,565 companies from 65 countries—a 16% increase compared to the previous edition. The exhibitions spanned 181,501 square meters, a 10% expansion in total exhibition space. Notably, 731 companies participated for the first time, representing an 82% increase, alongside 213 Emirati companies, which accounted for 16% of the total exhibitors, reflecting the advancement of the UAE’s defense industries sector.

Visitor turnout for IDEX and NAVDEX 2025 reached 206,073, reflecting a growth rate of over 55.5% compared to the previous edition. International visitors accounted for 57% of the total attendees from 167 countries, while local visitors made up 43%. The visitor demographics included 85% male attendees and 15% female attendees. The UAE ranked first in visitor numbers, followed by China, Turkey, the United States, India, France, Russia, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Germany, and Ukraine.

The 2025 International Defence Conference, held alongside the exhibitions, attracted over 1,800 attendees—a 25% increase from the previous edition. It featured participation from 55 military delegation heads, 40 CEOs of defense companies, 48 ambassadors, and 65 military attachés. Discussions centered on global security challenges, supply chain resilience, information warfare, and emerging threats in space, with 12 prominent speakers, including ministers and top defense officials.",,https://thearabianpost.com/adnec-groups-2024-economic-impact-reaches-aed8-5-billion-surpassing-previous-records/,,,uae,,news,,,,,,2,13,,10,,,thearabianpost.com,,,,,,,,positive,0.9994280934333801
News,gb,post,302903350,2025-03-21,"Qatar, Egypt stress need to resume implementation of Gaza ceasefire  Qatar and Egypt, the main mediators between Israel and Hamas, yesterday emphasised the importance of reinforcing joint efforts to implement the three-phase Gaza ceasefire agreement, according to statements by the Qatari and Egyptian foreign ministries.

This came during a phone call between Qatari Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mohammed Bin Abdulrahman Bin Jassim Al Thani, and Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr Badr Abdel Aati.

Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman Tamim Khallaf said Abdel Aati discussed with his Qatari counterpart the latest developments in the Gaza Strip and joint efforts to consolidate the ceasefire agreement and ensure the implementation of its three phases.

Khallaf added that the two sides also discussed ways to coordinate positions to promote the Arab plan for the reconstruction of Gaza, joint efforts to mobilise support for the enclave, and preparations for the Cairo International Conference for the Reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.

The officials agreed on the need to continue joint coordination to contain escalating tensions in the region and to launch a political settlement that ensures sustainable stability in the region, through the establishment of a Palestinian state, Khallaf added.

At dawn on Tuesday, Israel launched large scale air strikes on Gaza killing over 400 civilians and wounding hundreds more. Later on Wednesday, the Israeli occupation army announced the resumption of ground operations across Gaza.

The deal follows direct talks mediated by Qatar’s Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, marking the first face-to-face meeting between the two leaders since the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels intensified their offensive in the region.

The conflict in eastern DR Congo has claimed an estimated 7,000 lives since January, with the Congolese government accusing Rwanda of supporting the M23 rebels, allegations backed by the UN and the US but denied by Rwanda. Meanwhile, Rwanda insists its military actions are in self-defence against Congolese forces and allied militias.

A joint statement issued by Qatar’s Foreign Ministry confirmed both leaders’ commitment to halting hostilities but offered no specific details on how the ceasefire would be implemented or monitored. The statement also reaffirmed their pledge to continue discussions in Doha to lay the groundwork for lasting peace.

The meeting comes just a day after M23 rebels withdrew from Angola-led peace talks in protest against European Union sanctions on their leadership. With key eastern Congolese cities like Goma and Bukavu now under rebel control and previous peace negotiations failing, this latest agreement is seen as a critical test for diplomacy in the region.",,https://www.bellanaija.com/2025/03/congo-rwanda-ceasefire-qatar-talks/,,,nigeria,,news,,,,,,7,6,,3,,,bellanaija.com,,,,,,,,positive,0.9926855564117432

The Chairperson commends the Statesmen of the DRC and Rwanda for their commitment to dialogue and peaceful resolution of the crisis in Eastern DRC.

Union Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal highlighted this shift at the India-Qatar Business Forum, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in New Delhi.

The meeting held on Wednesday, between DRC President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan President Paul Kagame, mediated by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, aims to build the trust necessary to resolve the outstanding issues, Xinhua news agency reported.

""The trilateral meeting held in Doha marks an important step toward fostering peace and stability in the eastern DRC and the wider region,"" the Somalian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation said in a statement issued in Mogadishu, the country's capital.

The Somalian government commended the commitment of all parties to an immediate and unconditional cease-fire and expressed its full support for these diplomatic efforts, saying it stands in solidarity with the people of the DRC and Rwanda in their pursuit of lasting peace and prosperity.

""We extend our appreciation to the State of Qatar for its role in promoting constructive dialogue and mediation to resolve conflicts through peaceful means,"" the ministry said, adding that the discussions initiated in Doha serve as a crucial foundation for a sustainable resolution to the crisis.

The Doha meeting was the first time Kagame and Tshisekedi met since the March 23 Movement (M23) rebels intensified their offensive in the eastern DRC in recent months.

The rebel group advanced and seized the strategic city of Goma in January, followed by Bukavu in February.

The two leaders called for an ""immediate cease-fire"" on Tuesday after holding direct talks in Doha, but it was not immediately clear whether the M23 rebels who had canceled the peace talks in Angola would heed the cease-fire call.

According to a joint statement released on Tuesday by Qatar's Foreign Ministry, DRC President Felix Tshisekedi, Rwandan President Paul Kagame, and Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani attended the sit-down, Xinhua news agency reported.

The statement said the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to an ""immediate and unconditional"" ceasefire as agreed at a February summit held in the Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam, and further agreed on the need to continue discussions initiated in Doha to establish a solid foundation for lasting peace.

Fighting between the DRC government and the March 23 Movement (M23) rebel group has intensified in recent months as M23 launched major offensives in the eastern provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu, capturing several key towns.

The ongoing violence has displaced thousands, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in the eastern DRC.

The M23 called earlier on Tshisekedi to make an unequivocal public declaration committing to direct negotiations. The DRC government has consistently considered it a red line to sit at the same negotiation table with the rebels.

Meanwhile, the DRC has accused Rwanda of supporting the M23. Rwanda said the DRC military has allied with the Rwandan rebel group Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, which was allegedly involved in the 1994 genocide.

News,ng,post,302436762,2025-03-21,"Cleric stresses importance of knowledge for Muslims THE Deputy Chief Imam of the Muslim Community Centre Juma’a Mosque, Wuse, Abuja, Sheikh Tamim Yusuf Alhasan, has urged Muslims to seek knowledge to worship Allah appropriately and overcome challenges.

Sheikh Alhasan made the call on Sunday at the Afemai Islamic Movement (AIM) annual Ramadan lecture with the theme ‘The Importance of Knowledge and Evil of Ignorance’. 

“Islam is religion of knowledge. The first thing to have been revealed in the glorious Qur’an is a command to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to seek knowledge. So, we are here to serve Allah the Most High and there is no way you can serve Allah if you do not know Him.

“The only way you can know Allah is through knowledge, the knowledge of the Qur’an, the knowledge of the Hadith and the knowledge of other sources of Islamic knowledge. 

“Ignorance has so many implications and one of them is that there is no way you can worship Allah when you are ignorant. And somebody may be worshiping Allah thinking that he is doing the right thing while he is doing the wrong thing. And even the prayer we observe on a daily basis, he who does not know will continue to pray while his prayer will not be accepted,” Alhasan said.

The Amir (President) of AIM, Alhaji Ismail Abdul Qadir Danesi, said any good act is rewarded by Allah in manifold and seeking knowledge is goodness.

Danesi said: “You will agree with me that this is a very important topic, especially looking at the situation we find ourselves in today. We really need to sit down to learn the Holy Qur’an, to reflect on the Qur’an, and to imbibe the culture of Qur’an and to put it into practice.”

“Because we believe that is the only way that we can be free, we can be emancipated from the challenges of the current situation in Nigeria and globally. So, Qur’an is the key, the ultimate, the knowledge that Allah has sent to us through Prophet Muhammad.” 

‘Don’t commit illegality because of economic hardship’ 

In a related development, the principal of Zinaria International School, Mararaba, Nasarawa State, Ustaz Idris Al-Hassan, has called on Muslims against being tempted to meet their financial and other needs with illegal resources but seek Allah’s help and work for legitimate needs.

Al-Hassan made the call during the sixth annual Ramadan lecture of the Forum for Islamic Guidance (FIG), with the theme ‘Trusting Allah in Times of Economic Hardship’.

He said many prophets of Allah were tested and they overcame their challenges and even gained more with trust in Allah.

“We live in an era when economic uncertainties, inflation, job losses and financial constraints have become common struggles for many individuals and families. It is during such trying times that we are reminded of the profound importance of Tawakkul, that is, absolute trust in and reliance on Allah.

“Economic hardship should not lead us to despair or resort to unethical means but rather should strengthen our dependence on Allah and our commitment to honesty, patience and perseverance.

News,ng,post,303776472,2025-03-25,"ITUC-Africa calls for concrete actions to end eastern DRC conflict THE African Regional Organisation of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC-Africa) has welcomed the high-level peace talks between the Presidents of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, facilitated by the Emir of Qatar in Doha.

The discussions between President Félix Tshisekedi and President Paul Kagame mark a crucial step toward resolving the deep-rooted crisis in Eastern DRC that has displaced millions and fueled ongoing violence.

ITUC-Africa commended Qatar’s role in fostering dialogue but underscored that genuine peace demands more than diplomatic engagements.

The organisation stressed the need for urgent and verifiable actions, particularly the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the M23 rebel group, whose presence continues to destabilise the region.

Calling for African-led solutions, ITUC-Africa urged the African Union (AU) to take an active role in ensuring the peace process is guided by homegrown strategies.

It emphasised the necessity for regional bodies such as the East African Community (EAC) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to coordinate efforts for sustainable peace.

The crisis in Eastern DRC extends beyond political instability, ITUC-Africa noted, describing it as a humanitarian disaster worsened by human rights violations and external exploitation of the region’s mineral wealth.

The international community, including trade unions, must press for accountability and justice to break the cycle of conflict.

ITUC-Africa reaffirmed its solidarity with the people of the DRC and others across Africa seeking peace and economic justice. As part of its commitment, the organisation announced that the 2025 Africa Day celebrations would feature a colloquium on peace, industrialisation, and trade, bringing together key stakeholders, including the African Union and the African Development Bank, to explore practical solutions for the continent’s development.",,https://tribuneonlineng.com/ituc-africa-calls-for-concrete-actions-to-end-eastern-drc-conflict/,,,nigeria,,news,,,,,,1,5,,10,,,tribuneonlineng.com,,,,,,,,positive,0.999502420425415
News,ng,post,296999684,2025-03-05,"Ceasefire: Arab leaders back Egyptian proposal, counter Trump’s Gaza plan Arab leaders have endorsed Egypt’s postwar plan for the Gaza Strip, which would allow its roughly two million Palestinian residents to remain, in a direct counterproposal to U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to depopulate the territory and redevelop it as a beach destination.

Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi announced the endorsement following a high-level summit in Cairo on Tuesday. It signals a widespread rejection of Trump’s proposal. 

However, whether Israel or the United States will accept the Egyptian plan remains unclear. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment.

According to CNN, the summit included key regional figures such as the emir of Qatar, the vice president of the United Arab Emirates, and the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, alongside UN Secretary-General António Guterres. Their support is seen as crucial for any postwar arrangement in Gaza.

El-Sissi, addressing the gathering, stated that the plan “preserves the right of Palestinian people in rebuilding their nation and guarantees their existence on their land.”

Arab League chief Ahmed Aboul Gheit said the summit’s final communique calls on the UN Security Council to deploy an international peacekeeping force in Gaza and the occupied West Bank.

“Peace is the Arabs’ strategic option,” he told a news conference, noting that the communique rejected the transfer of Palestinians and endorsed Egypt’s reconstruction plan. “The Egyptian plan creates a path for a new security and political context in Gaza,” he added.

Meanwhile, Israel has backed what it describes as an alternative U.S. proposal focused on securing a ceasefire and the release of hostages taken in Hamas’ attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which triggered the war. 

ALSO READ: Tariffs: We’re ready for any type of war – China fires back at Trump

To pressure Hamas into accepting the proposal, Israel has blocked food, fuel, medicine, and other supplies from entering Gaza, warning of further consequences if the group does not comply. This blockade has drawn international criticism, with human rights groups arguing it violates Israel’s obligations as an occupying power under international law.

The new plan reportedly requires Hamas to release half of its remaining hostages, the group’s key bargaining chip in exchange for an extension of the ceasefire and a commitment to negotiating a lasting truce. 

However, Israel has not indicated a willingness to release additional Palestinian prisoners, a key element of previous negotiations.

They noted that another Islamic country Iran had released 77 Indian nationals in 2024 and 43, including 12 fishermen, in 2023, while the Bahrain government pardoned 250 Indian prisoners during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit in 2019. The Emir of Kuwait freed 22 Indians and reduced sentences for 97 others after diplomatic talks in 2017. Official sources said India's regular interventions have led to regular release of the Indian fishermen by Sri Lanka and 3,697 have been freed since 2014. Since 2014, relentless diplomatic efforts have secured the release of 2,639 fishermen and 71 civilian prisoners from Pakistan, they added. The officials said that a lot of these breakthroughs were possible due to the personal rapport Modi shares with global leaders. ""These successful interventions underscore India's growing global diplomatic stature and the Modi government's unwavering commitment to protecting the Indian citizens abroad,"" said an official.

News,in,post,304445200,2025-03-26,"Sunanda K. Datta-Ray | Will Jakarta’s Prabowo Play More Active Role in Mideast? With booming Israeli guns raining death and destruction on the Gaza Strip audible, figuratively speaking, in Java nearly 6,000 miles away, there is every reason for Indonesia to play a more prominent role in bringing West Asia’s crisis to an end.Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince, Qatar’s Emir and Turkey’s President are the main players now, with US President Donald Trump inevitably pulling the strings. They are a reminder that Prabowo Subianto, head of the world’s most populous Muslim country, is missing from the dramatis personae.The Palestinians obviously feel President Prabowo’s absence since Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian President, sent a special envoy to him with a letter in the midst of last week’s raging life-and-death struggle. “We have brought a letter concerning the relationship between Indonesia and Palestine, as well as the broader Palestinian issue, particularly the worsening conditions under Israeli aggression”, the envoy, Mahmoud Al-Habbash, declared in Jakarta. “We trust Indonesia and its position on the Palestinian struggle, and we believe that the Indonesian government and its people will continue to support Palestine’s pursuit of freedom and independence.”The letter coincided with a new law in Jakarta extending the military’s participation in civilian governance and thereby strengthening the authority of President Prabowo, who was the chief guest at the recent Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi, which also marked 75 years of India-Indonesia diplomatic relations. His former father-in-law, Suharto, ruled Indonesia for 31 years. Although he and Suharto’s daughter Titiek separated shortly after Suharto’s presidency ended in 1998, Prabowo always saw himself as a potential successor and remained a strong supporter of Suharto’s regime.Defying geopolitical practice, Indonesia, the world’s third most populous democracy and eighth largest economy in terms of PPP, has punched under its weight since the mid-1960s when the Americans were suspected of engineering the bloody coup that ended the 21-year reign of Jawaharlal Nehru’s old comrade in arms, the charismatic Sukarno. The chief guest at India’s very first Republic Day in 1950, Sukarno famously claimed at the United Nations that his country was the modern successor of the Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit empire of more than 17,000 islands based in eastern Java from 1293 to around 1527. The ebullient Sukarno, who offered submarines to defendKarachi and planes to bolster Pakistan’s air defence against India in 1965, was a founding member of the United Nations, Asean, NAM, OIC and numerous other international bodies.Not that Suharto did too badly. He initiated the Istiklal Mosque in Sarajevo, which he visited in 1995, to replace the hundreds of mosques destroyed during the Christian Bosnian rebellion and local Muslims still sometimes call it the Suharto Mosque. But although respected as the strongman of Southeast Asia, Suharto was focused on his own country and its growth. Despite bomb outrages by Arab fanatics, Indonesia has never been a fundamentalist society.Among other Indonesian leaders, the seventh President, Joko Widodo, popularly called “Jokowi”, was India’s Republic Day guest in 2018 while the sixth President, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, came in 2011. Positioned next to Merdeka (Freedom) Square, the Catholic Jakarta Cathedral and the Immanuel Church (Dutch Reformed), the Istiqlal Mosque reflects a Sufi heritage that keeps jihadism at bay. Even President Prabowo admits to not being very familiar with the Holy Quran.No one knows whether he will follow a solitary course in governing or join Megawati Sukarnoputri, the grand dame of Indonesian politics and leader of Indonesia’s largest party, the PDIP. Sukarno’s daughter was President of Indonesia from 2001 to 2004, the first female in that position. Her other claims to distinction include being the first leader born after the country’s independence to become President, and the child of a Hindu mother who converted to Islam to marry Sukarno. It is also worth remembering that Mr Prabowo has sought the presidency since 2004, displaying patience and skill in chasing power. He has repeatedly promised to continue his predecessor’s development and infrastructure-oriented policies, portraying himself as heir to a long line of nation-building Presidents.India’s involvement goes back to Indonesia’s war of independence in 1945 which was a catalyst for the 1947 Asian Relations Conference in New Delhi, the first Asian essay in global diplomacy. Not only did India staunchly support Indonesia and help it to establish relations with the Palestinian delegation, but Jawaharlal Nehru’s interim government placed restrictions on Dutch shipping and airlines, affecting the movement of military supplies from the Netherlands. As Nehru’s colleague, Syed Ali Zaheer, reported after acting as the unofficial tour guide of King Abdallah of Jordan: “I stressed particularly the Indonesian question, and said that although Indonesia was a...",,https://www.deccanchronicle.com/opinion/columnists/sunanda-k-datta-ray-will-jakartas-prabowo-play-more-active-role-in-mideast-1869193,,,india,,news,,,,,,8,11,,9,,,deccanchronicle.com,,,,,,,,positive,0.9626770615577698
News,in,post,303207782,2025-03-23,"Gujarat Engineer Detained In Qatar For Three Months Without Charges; Family Seeks PM’s Intervention Amit Gupta, an Indian engineer from Gujarat’s Vadodara, has been in solitary confinement in Qatar for over three months on allegations of data theft, despite no formal charges being pressed against him. His family has sought intervention from the Indian government, urging for his immediate release.
Gupta, a senior IT professional working for Tech Mahindra in Qatar, was detained by Qatari authorities on January 1, 2025. His mother, Pushpa Gupta, revealed that he was taken into custody by Qatar’s state security following a meal with his family at a restaurant. Since then, he has remained in detention without any explanation from the authorities.
His parents, Pushpa and Jagdish Gupta, a retired ONGC chief engineer, have been tirelessly trying to secure his release. The family met Vadodara MP Hemang Joshi and requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention in the matter.
Indian Embassy Assists
According to sources cited by news agency IANS, the Indian Embassy in Qatar is fully aware of the situation and is extending all possible assistance. Officials have been in regular contact with Gupta’s family, legal representatives, and Qatari authorities to understand the circumstances surrounding his detention.
However, Gupta’s mother, who traveled to Qatar to seek answers, was met with disappointment. She claimed that India’s ambassador in Qatar acknowledged the case but admitted that there had been no “positive response” from the Qatari authorities so far.
Meanwhile, MP Hemang Joshi expressed concern over the situation. He stated, ""It is the right of the parents to know the reason behind their son’s arrest. When such incidents happen abroad, families are naturally worried. I will push for strong representation in this case.""
History of Detentions in Qatar
In 2022, eight former Indian Navy personnel, including high-ranking officers, were detained in Qatar under espionage charges. They were sentenced to death in 2023, though their sentences were later commuted. Following diplomatic intervention, they were released in February 2024 by an order from Qatar’s Emir.
Given this precedent, Gupta’s family fears a prolonged legal battle and is urging the Indian government to take swift action. ""He is our only support, and we deserve to know why he is being held without charges,"" said his father.

News,in,post,302857650,2025-03-22,"Sports News | After Historic Olympic Election Comes Leadership Issues for IOC President Kirsty Coventry Costa Navarino (Greece), Mar 22 (AP) After enjoying a stunning election win comes the sober business of leading the International Olympic Committee for Kirsty Coventry. The first woman president elected in the IOC's 131-year history began Friday in a breakfast meeting with Thomas Bach to start their transition. The formal handover is on Olympic Day, June 23. Also Read | NZ vs PAK 4th T20I 2025 Preview: Likely Playing XIs, Key Battles, H2H and More About New Zealand vs Pakistan Cricket Match in Mount Maunganui. They agreed Coventry will take precedence in major IOC decisions in the next three months. The 41-year-old sports minister of Zimbabwe will soon resign her government position and plans to move with her family in April to the Olympic home city, Lausanne in Switzerland. Also Read | Hyderabad Police Deploy 3,000 Personnel for IPL 2025 Matches at Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium in Uppal. Here's a look at some of the issues ahead: Equality for women Coventry's victory is the biggest statement of Bach's consistent policies to promote women in Olympic sports and politics. Can the next layer below the IOC — governing bodies of Olympic sports, national Olympic committees — also make progress? “You realize that there is still a lot to do,” Bach said on Friday. He noted that from next month just one of those sports will have a woman president: IOC member Petra Sörling in table tennis. Coventry has pledged to protect women's sports and athletes. She explained on Friday how as the sports minister in Zimbabwe she removed the national soccer federation's board after women referees reported being sexually harassed. It helped to push FIFA to suspend Zimbabwean soccer citing government interference in the sport and she has no regret. “There are certain things close to my heart that I will never tolerate,” she said. Coventry wants the IOC to take “more of a leading role” on gender eligibility and will create a taskforce to analyze the issue. The newly recognized World Boxing body, which was not involved in the Paris Olympics, is separately updating its rules this year. India's ambition A win for Coventry looks favorable toward being an ultimate victory for India and its influential IOC member Nita Ambani. The two women are reportedly close. The Ambani family, the richest in Asia, hosted the IOC annual meeting in 2023 in Mumbai that promoted ambitions for India to host the Summer Games. A key decision for the Coventry-led IOC is finding a host for 2036. One rival to India is Qatar, whose ruling Emir has been an IOC member for 24 years, and which has been overlooked three times before. An announcement expected soon is to confirm India's first top-tier Olympic sponsorship that was all but promised last August in Paris. There, Ambani hosted a hospitality house to promote Indian culture and sports. There is no set timetable for a decision on 2036. Bach's signature policy on choosing hosts ended an era of blockbuster campaigns and contested votes. Now, a favored bid that effectively and discreetly lobbies the IOC can be fast-tracked into exclusive negotiations. Athlete benefits It is unclear how and when athletes might get a better deal within the IOC's strict commercial rules. They have long protected exclusivity for rights-holding Olympic broadcasters and sponsors. One of Coventry's beaten election rivals, Sebastian Coe, leads World Athletics. It broke an Olympic taboo by paying $50,000 prize money for track and field champions in Paris last year. In Los Angeles in 2028, silver and bronze medalists also will be rewarded. Coe said his election pledges for athletes would include “sharing their data, giving them better access to sponsorships, and being more liberal, and making sure the (Olympic) brand was more accessible to them.” The election runner-up, Juan Antonio Samaranch, promised letting athletes use clips of their Olympic performances and help them be social media influencers. Coventry did not have those kinds of ideas in her election platform, nor advanced them when she represented athletes on the IOC executive board from 2018-21. However, she pledged to work with election rivals to see which of their policies can make progress. Russia return? There is no obvious path for the IOC to lift its suspension of Russia's Olympic body while four regional sports councils in eastern Ukraine remain under Russian control. Still, Vladimir Putin is already working on the new IOC president, offering “sincere congratulations” on her win. “The results of the vote convincingly attest to your high authority in the sporting world and the recognition of your outstanding personal achievements,” read a statement to Coventry from the Kremlin. The 2026 Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo Winter Games open next February with the IOC excluding Russia from team sports — including Putin's favorite ice hockey — since the invasion of Ukraine. Individual Russian athletes could compete in Paris last year if they passed vetting as neutrals. Future presidents? The next IOC leadership election is in 2033, though the next vacancy with a contested race could be 12 years away in 2037. Coventry would be only 53 on reaching her term limit. Projecting far into the Olympic future, Tony Estanguet rejoined the IOC membership on Friday aged 46. He has clear potential after organizing the successful Paris Olympics. If Coventry's successor is to be a woman, Princess Reema Bandar al Saud could contend. She has been Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States since 2019 and joined the IOC one year later.

News,in,post,301151856,2025-03-17,"Sports News | Olympic Contest to Pick IOC President is Quirky and Controlled by Tight Campaign and Voting Rules Costa Navarino (Greece), Mar 17 (AP) The IOC is the undisputed champion of running the most tightly managed sports election, one compared by veteran Olympic watchers to a conclave to pick a pope. Some of the seven presidential candidates in the contest on Thursday have aired frustrations with getting limited access to their fellow International Olympic Committee members during a five-month campaign. The voters themselves will get minimal updates between rounds of casting secret ballots on election day. Also Read | IPL 2025: A Look at Teams With Most Titles Ahead of Indian Premier League Season 18. ""It has been difficult to engage,"" one leading contender, Sebastian Coe, told reporters last week before heading to Greece. ""In future, this just needs to be a more open and expansive process. I think the membership deserves that."" Also Read | New Zealand vs Pakistan 2nd T20I 2025 Free Live Streaming Online: How To Watch NZ vs PAK Cricket Match Live Telecast on TV in India?. Those members are as quirky and curious a collective as the sets of IOC election rules that bind them. Among the 109 eligible voters in the IOC's invited and exclusive club are royal family members, including the Emir of Qatar, former lawmakers and diplomats, business leaders including billionaires, present and past Olympic athletes plus Oscar-winning actress Michelle Yeoh. Only IOC members can stand as candidates and a long-time perception has been that outgoing president Thomas Bach has promoted a protégé he hopes will win — even if playing a favourite would seem to breach political neutrality the Olympic movement holds dear. Bach declined to be drawn in detail on Monday when asked if he intervened with voters on behalf of Kirsty Coventry, the two-time swimming gold medalist from Zimbabwe. She would be the first woman and first African president in the IOC's 131-year history. ""What I felt obliged to say about the profile of my successor I have said in Paris,"" said Bach, whose hands-on executive presidency ends formally in June after the term-limited 12 years. Seven months ago at the Paris Olympics, Bach said ""new times are calling for new leaders,"" citing the need for a successor immersed in a ""technological tsunami"" of the digital world. ""I have nothing to add to this,"" he said on Monday. He spoke at a news conference after chairing a meeting of his executive board that includes three of the seven candidates, including Coventry. Coventry is the only woman in the race and just the second-ever female candidate to lead the IOC. A win on Thursday for the sports minister of Zimbabwe would add to Bach's legacy of gender equality policies. ""I don't feel that he is out campaigning for me,"" she told reporters in an online call in January, adding she ""had a good relationship with President Bach since 2013."" Low-key campaign ============= IOC election rules barred candidates from publishing campaign videos, organizing public meetings or taking part in public debates. Voters could not publicly endorse their pick. Candidates were allowed to write a manifesto the IOC published on the same day in December, then make just one official presentation to their voters at Olympic headquarters in January. Voters could not ask any questions after each 15-minute presentation that was not broadcast. ""If I was the president I think I'd be a little more flexible,"" Prince Feisal al Hussein of Jordan said that day in Lausanne, Switzerland. The seven candidates have no official media event before Thursday's vote, though all will go on Tuesday to nearby Ancient Olympia. A formal ceremony there with a Bach speech opens an election gathering that runs through Friday. Closed-doors election ================ The IOC will cut the online stream of its meeting at a resort hotel when the election process starts on Thursday at about 4 p.m. in Greece (1400 GMT). Members will have their phones and tablets collected and stored. Most IOC staff must leave the room so only voters and essential election monitors stay. When a winner emerges the doors will open, the streamed broadcast turned back on and the announcement made. Voting rules ========= About 100 members should be present and eligible in the first round to cast electronic votes. Candidates can vote but any compatriot cannot for as long as they stay in the contest. The winner must get an absolute majority that likely will not happen in the first round. Several rounds could be needed. Until there is a winner, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. If there is a tie for the lowest total, a runoff vote between them will decide who is eliminated. However, voters will not be told the totals for each candidate after each round. Instead, Bach ""will announce only the name of the candidate who will not participate in the following round of voting,"" the IOC rules state.

News,in,post,296686750,2025-03-04,"World News | Arab Leaders Endorse Counterproposal to Trump's Gaza Plan, with Ceasefire Uncertain Cairo, Mar 4 (AP) Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said Tuesday that Arab leaders have endorsed Egypt's postwar plan for the Gaza Strip that would allow its roughly 2 million Palestinians to remain in the territory. Meeting in Cairo on Tuesday, the leaders endorsed a counterproposal to President Donald Trump's plan to depopulate the territory and redevelop it as a beach destination.

It was unclear if Israel or the United States would accept the Egyptian plan. The summit hosted by Egypt included the emir of Qatar, the vice president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia — countries whose support is crucial for any postwar plan.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also attended. Israel has embraced what it says is an alternative US proposal for the ceasefire itself and the release of hostages taken in Hamas' attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which triggered the war. Israel has blocked the entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza to try to get Hamas to accept the new proposal and has warned of additional consequences, raising fears of a return to fighting. The suspension of aid drew widespread criticism, with human rights groups saying that it violated Israel's obligations as an occupying power under international law. The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages — the militant group's main bargaining chip — in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners — a key component of the first phase. Egypt's postwar plan A 112-page draft of Egypt's USD 53 billion plan obtained by The Associated Press foresees rebuilding Gaza by 2030 without removing its population. The first phase calls for starting the removal of unexploded ordnance and clearing the more than 50 million tons of rubble left by Israel's bombardment and military offensives. Hundreds of thousands of temporary housing units would be set up where Gaza's population could live while reconstruction takes place. The rubble would be recycled, with some of it used as infill to create expanded lands on Gaza's Mediterranean coast. In the following years, the plan envisages completely reshaping the strip, building “sustainable, green and walkable” housing and urban areas, with renewable energy. It renovates agricultural lands and creates industrial zones and large park areas. It also calls for the opening of an airport, a fishing port and a commercial port. The Oslo peace accords in the 1990s called for the opening of an airport and a commercial port in Gaza, but the projects withered as the peace process collapsed. Under the plan, Hamas would cede power to an interim administration of political independents until a reformed Palestinian Authority can assume control. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, head of the Western-backed authority and an opponent of Hamas, was attending the summit. Israel has ruled out any role for the Palestinian Authority in Gaza and, along with the United States, has demanded Hamas' disarmament. Hamas, which doesn't accept Israel's existence, has said it's willing to cede power in Gaza to other Palestinians, but won't give up its arms until there is a Palestinian state. Addressing the summit, el-Sissi said that the plan “preserves the right of Palestinian people in rebuilding their nation and guarantees their existence on their land.” He said there is a need for a parallel path for peace to achieve a “comprehensive, just and lasting settlement” to the Palestinian cause. “There will be no true peace without the establishment of the Palestinian state,” el-Sissi said. “It's time to adopt the launching of a serious and effective political path that leads to a permanent and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause according to the resolutions of international legitimacy.” An early draft of the statement endorsing the plan called for a “permanent and just solution” for the Palestinian cause, and for the UN Security Council to deploy international peacekeepers in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The mention of peacekeepers was dropped from a later draft. Israel has vowed to maintain open-ended security control over both territories, which it captured in the 1967 Mideast war and which Palestinians want for their future state. Israel's government and most of its political class are opposed to Palestinian statehood. Trump shocked the region last month when he suggested Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians be resettled in other countries. He said the United States would take ownership of the territory and redevelop it into a Middle Eastern “Riviera.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu embraced the proposal, which was roundly rejected by Palestinians, Arab countries and human rights experts, who said it would likely violate international law. Riccardo Fabiani, North Africa director at the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based think tank, said the summit is “a key pillar in Egypt's strategy” to counter Trump's plan for Gaza. “Egypt is trying to present a credible alternative focused on reconstruction and an indirect consultation mechanism for Hamas that could reassure Israel and the US,” he said. “The idea is also to continue to frame this plan as part of a new push towards the two-state solution.” Children from Gaza head to Jordan for treatment Trump has suggested that Egypt and Jordan, two close American allies, could take in large numbers of Palestinian refugees from Gaza. Both countries have adamantly rejected any such plan. Meeting with Trump at the White House last month, King Abdullah II of Jordan offered to take in around 2,000 children for medical treatment. The first group of around 30 children left Gaza for Jordan on Tuesday, according to Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The children are being accompanied by up to two family members. Jordan said that the children are amputees and will return to Gaza when their treatment is complete. The kingdom has also set up field hospitals in Gaza and delivered aid by air and land. The war began with Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 people hostage. Hamas-led militants are still holding 59 hostages, 35 of whom are believed to be dead. Most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements. Israel has rescued eight living hostages and recovered the remains of dozens more. Israel's 15-month offensive killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It doesn't say how many were fighters, but the ministry says women and children made up more than half the dead. Israel says it killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The offensive destroyed large areas of Gaza, including much of its health system and other infrastructure. At its height, the war displaced about 90 per cent of the population, mostly within the territory, where hundreds of thousands packed into squalid tent camps and schools repurposed as shelters.

Hibatullah Akhundzada was speaking during a sermon marking Eid al-Fitr, an Islamic holiday, at the Eidgah Mosque in the southern city of Kandahar. ""There is no need for laws that originate from the West. We will create our own laws,"" Akhundzada said as he emphasized the importance for Islamic laws, according to audio of his message that was published on X by the Taliban government’s chief spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid. FAYE HALL, AMERICAN DETAINED BY TALIBAN, HAS BEEN RELEASED The Taliban’s interpretation of sharia has resulted in restrictions for Afghan women and girls, who have been denied an education, working roles in many job fields and from appearing in most public spaces. These laws have isolated the Taliban in the international community, but they have still been able to establish diplomatic ties with some countries, including China and the United Arab Emirates. Akhundzada has taken a stronger approach on policy since the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in 2021 during the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops from the region, despite some officials initially promising a more moderate government. TALIBAN FREES AMERICAN HOSTAGE GEORGE GLEZMANN FOLLOWING NEGOTIATIONS WITH US, QATAR The terror group's supreme leader criticized the West in his remarks on Sunday by saying non-believers were unified against Muslims and that the U.S. and other countries were united in their hostility toward Islam, pointing to the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. Akhundzada said democracy had come to an end in Afghanistan and sharia was in effect. He also argued that supporters of democracy were attempting to separate the people from the Taliban government. The Taliban have no credible opposition inside or outside the country, although some senior figures within the government have criticized the leadership’s decision-making process and concentration of power in Akhundzada’s circle.

News,us,post,306032462,2025-03-31,"The Trump Factor in the Middle East This article appears in the April 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here.

Before President Trump even took office in January, his personal envoy delivered an unlikely win. Since last spring, President Biden’s diplomats had been unable to get Israel and Hamas to agree to a cease-fire. But Trump’s man, real estate billionaire Steve Witkoff, joined the Biden team’s effort weeks before the inauguration. Witkoff put immense pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reportedly saying that his relationship with the incoming American president depended on him accepting the deal. After a 96-hour marathon of talks in Qatar, Witkoff clinched a cease-fire and hostage exchange.

In so doing, Trump appeared to make good on his robust outreach to Arab and Muslim voters, who had helped him carry swing states. The campaign promised that Trump would prioritize two things: “an end to the wars, and a lasting peace in the Middle East that is satisfactory to all parties,” Bishara Bahbah, chair of Arab Americans for Trump, told me. And he had already checked off item one.

But weeks into his second term, Trump suggested that the U.S. would forcibly displace Palestinians in Gaza, that the United States would occupy the territory as part of a “Gaza Riviera” plan, full of threats and ethnic cleansing. He doubled down on the idea in an outlandish AI-generated social media post, with him lying on the beach shirtless beside Netanyahu, and a song playing “no more tunnels, no more fear, Trump Gaza is finally here.”

The cease-fire did not hold beyond its first phase, amid Israel’s violations. Israel has also blocked all humanitarian transfers to Palestinians, in what is by any measure of international law a war crime. Among the other seemingly contradictory moves, Trump dismantled most international assistance with the exception of Israel, where he fast-tracked $12 billion of arms sales and military aid.

I asked Bahbah, who is Palestinian American, how he squares Trump’s cease-fire with the rest of it. “President Trump’s talk about a Riviera of the Middle East and displacement of Palestinians really, really upset the Arab American, Muslim American communities, but at the same time we know that the president was throwing this idea out as a negotiating tool.” It wasn’t offensive enough for him and his group to break with the president. “I don’t see them as really being serious policy statements,” Bahbah says.

Trump’s varied coalition of appointees, donors, and other informal advisers each want different things from him.

With Trump back in the White House, foreign-policy observers are again scrambling to make sense of his unconventional brand of statecraft: how much to take literally versus seriously, whether everything is transactional and personality-driven or whether a broader intent can be surmised. Middle East stakeholders are giving Trump the benefit of the doubt despite his aggressive and outrageous threats against Palestinians, a group that has been subject to what human rights groups call a genocide and of whom millions have already been internally displaced by Israel. There is no Trump doctrine to be gleaned, but there is a Trump factor: this president’s capacity, whether because world leaders fear him or trust him, to bring about definitive, comprehensive, and structural changes that have long-lasting policy effects.

This assessment of Trump is by no means an effort to wishcast him into being a president of peace, or obscure actions that are detrimental to American interests. Instead, this is an acknowledgment that Trump’s approach to Israel and Palestine, even in his first term, fundamentally reshaped American policy. He shattered taboos by moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, labeling products made in the occupied West Bank as Israeli, withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, and refocusing all U.S. diplomatic efforts on pushing forward normalization deals between Israel and Arab states that cut out Palestinians.

Biden took Trump’s policy and boxed himself in. There was no Trump-proofing of Middle East policy because Biden’s team had largely taken on its predecessor’s strategy. Trump, then, is a product, not a departure, from long-standing American policy.

What’s also clear is that Trump’s varied coalition of appointees, donors, and other informal advisers each want different things from him. Witkoff may be a pragmatist despite a staunch pro-Israel orientation, but Middle East policymaking will nonetheless be contested. Trump has elevated many pro-Israel stalwarts, alongside foreign-policy realists.

But will that mean that the president would stand by should Israel strike Iran’s nuclear program, or perhaps even enable such an escalatory attack? Will Trump facilitate Israel’s mass displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, or the further displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank? What will his emphasis on Israel and Saudi Arabia dealmaking mean for Palestinians, other Arab neighbors, and Americans?

There may be much to disagree with, sometimes vehemently so, about Trump in the Middle East. But as one career official who served during Trump’s first term put it, there’s validity to breaking with the Mideast policy of the establishment, which created an Israeli-Palestinian peace process that has long been on ice and deepened endless destructive wars. “A theme that is consistent between 45 and 47 is that the institutions and norms that we have built up and clung to for quite some time have not been working,” he told me. “They haven’t been working for American interests. They haven’t been working for global stability.”

EVERYONE IS TRYING TO MAKE SENSE of the gap between Trump’s words and actions. Those around him interpret his remarks with a generosity rarely afforded to any other politician. Witkoff has avoided discussing the Riviera plan and told the American Jewish Committee that Trump is talking this way about Gaza “because for the last four decades, the other ways of thinking have not worked.”

Many observers, particularly Republicans, have been working overtime to ascribe a degree of soundness or clarity to Trump’s often unhinged outbursts. H.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security adviser from 2017 to 2018, laid out a framework for interpreting the president at the Council on Foreign Relations. In the Oval Office during his first term, Trump had suggested taking the curious step of bombing fentanyl labs in Mexico. “I don’t think he was really asking me for options to bomb the labs,” McMaster explained. But he was, in essence, saying, “What we’re doing right now is not working. Why don’t you bring me some options?” In other words, while Democrats, progressives, and others call out the dangerous, off-the-cuff remarks of the president, his supporters strain to find a kernel of actionable policy.

The only consistency, according to another former national security adviser, John Bolton, is that the president looks after his own interests and relationships. “His thinking was like an archipelago of dots (like individual real estate deals), leaving the rest of us to discern—or create—policy,” he writes in his White House memoir, The Room Where It Happened. “That had its pros and cons.” It gives room for advisers to advance their own pet projects and also leads to intense infighting, and often stagnation.

Still, many assessments of Trump’s governing style from the first term are pertinent. The wanton demolition of American foreign assistance worldwide will have major implications not only for Palestinians but also neighboring Middle East countries that have come to rely on American development and humanitarian programs. To understand it all, I keep coming back to the 2018 coinage of Prospect alum Adam Serwer in The Atlantic: The cruelty is the point.

Going after the U.S. Agency for International Development shows an eagerness to punish agencies perceived to have a progressive bent. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller has claimed, without evidence, that 98 percent of USAID staff had donated to Kamala Harris or another left-wing candidate. Beyond the effects on some 10,000 federal workers and contractors, the suffering outside the United States will be vast and unprecedented, and certainly detrimental to American soft power in the Middle East and elsewhere.

Note that the International Development Finance Corporation, another federal agency focused on foreign assistance, hasn’t been completely wiped out, likely because it helps companies rather than individuals. Trump’s appointee to run it is Benjamin Black, the son of private equity billionaire Leon Black.

The cruelty similarly seems to be the point of launching a crackdown on Palestine activists, especially on university campuses. ICE’s abduction of Columbia student protester and legal U.S. resident Mahmoud Khalil offers the most extreme example to date. The weaponization of antisemitism claims and the emphasis on law enforcement to limit speech and political activity mirrors Trump’s first-term policies like the so-called Muslim ban and the harsh response to Black Lives Matter protesters. It’s worth emphasizing, as the historian Ussama Makdisi has, that the casual racism against Palestinians, as epitomized by the Trump Gaza video, is the “culmination of a bipartisan U.S. consensus that for a century has waged war on the idea that Palestinians deserve equality and freedom.”

It’s no coincidence that one of Trump’s first major speeches of this term was at a Saudi investment summit in Miami, much like his first foreign visit, in 2017, was to Riyadh. In Miami, he told business titans that the kingdom is “a special place with special leaders,” and celebrated its hosting of a U.S.-Russia summit in Riyadh. He lambasted “the fake news media” to a crowd convened by the kingdom’s primary sovereign wealth fund, which Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud oversees.

It was all the more disturbing considering that the CIA determined that MBS had ordered the torture, killing, and disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Which is to say, forget human rights, press freedom, and accountability for transnational crimes—core tenets of American foreign policy across administrations of both parties. Elon Musk sat in the front row next to MBS confidant Yassir Al-Rumayyan, who runs the Saudi fund. Everything is business.

But that also means that Trump likes to throw fresh eyes on everything and explore risky avenues in the hopes of a good payout. “Well, this didn’t work. What about that? What’s the ultimate goal? The ultimate goal is to have a peaceful Middle East. How do we get there? And yeah, he doesn’t care what taboos may be broken,” a former Trump White House official told me. “Corporate America does that often, sometimes with good results and sometimes with awful results.”

Trump is willing to push the bounds of taste at every turn in order to stay in the spotlight, using racism and insult comedy to provoke. “There’s a real entertainment angle to everything he does,” a senior defense official from Trump’s first term told me. “He is super entertaining, and his base thinks he is hilarious. It’s not that deep.”

The unpredictability is constant. It’s hard to imagine any other president meeting in the Oval Office with freed Israeli hostages at the same time his envoy is engaging in direct talks with Hamas. “Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,” Trump posted in early March on Truth Social. He’s all in on war crimes while being in direct talks with Hamas. He’s all over the place.

That unpredictability, as the former career official told me, has a certain methodology to it. “There’s a real art,” he explained, “keeping people off balance, and throwing out at times suggestions that just mix things up and cause people to lose their minds for a little bit, in hopes with following that up with a suggestion that is also really good for the United States.”

And it should be said that the most influential adviser is always the last person in the room with him.

AS PRESIDENT TRUMP WENT AROUND the chamber shouting out officials in his speech to Congress in early March, it became clear that Witkoff holds a stature in this administration on par with cabinet leaders. He’s Trump’s personal White House emissary and has his full faith, especially as compared to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. “Good luck, Marco,” Trump said in the speech. “Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong.”

In contrast to setting Rubio up as the fall guy, Trump didn’t mention Witkoff by name but ticked off many of his accomplishments, including the release of American schoolteacher Marc Fogel from Russian prison and the return of Israeli hostages from Gaza, which are admittedly pretty remarkable wins for a first month of the presidency.

Witkoff brings the hard-nosed demeanor of a Harlem landlord who used to carry a sidearm and once kept a copy of the book Tough Jews on his desk. A 1999 New York Observer profile called him a “knifelike man.” Even the piece’s title was evocative: “Steve Witkoff’s Nine Lives: Tough Guys Don’t Fold—They Crawl Back From the Abyss.” He survived boom-and-bust cycles as he built a real estate empire in Manhattan. But though Witkoff emerges from a traditional pro-Israel background and Trump’s New York developer milieu, pragmatism so far is the defining feature of his diplomacy.

Several sources told me that Witkoff will be the main address for Israel policy, in contrast to Biden, who had several points of contact: Secretary of State Tony Blinken, CIA director Bill Burns, national security adviser Jake Sullivan, and Middle East coordinator Brett McGurk.

But beyond Witkoff running point, there’s not much cohesion to Trump’s Middle East policy—likely by design. “It’s a wide range of voices,” Victoria Coates, a former deputy national security adviser to Trump, said recently at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “That’s what he likes to have around him. He likes to hear from a lot of different people before he makes decisions.” The added caveat, as the writer Sam Adler-Bell recently argued in New York magazine, is that this leads to a Godfather-style model of various factions battling for power, none of them quite satisfied and all of them on edge.

There’s not much cohesion to Trump’s Middle East policy—likely by design.

Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, holds traditional pro-Israel views. A former representative to Florida and a Green Beret, he has assembled a team of career officials and Republican foreign-policy hands. Among them is longtime Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committee aide Eric Trager, who wrote a 2016 book on the Muslim Brotherhood’s brief stint in power in Egypt.

Iran will be a contentious fault line among Trump’s varied team. Waltz has expressed hawkish dogma on Iran, arguing that the U.S. ought not to stop Israel from launching attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. This stands in immense contrast to Vice President JD Vance and his advisers, who trend toward realism and strike a different tone entirely.

One fulcrum point is the Defense Department’s number three appointee, who if confirmed will set policy for the entire Pentagon. Elbridge Colby represents the realist strand in Trumpworld. As a strategist, he has argued strongly against attacking Iran, a view he backtracked on in his recent confirmation hearing as pro-Israel hawks lined up against him. He prioritizes a defense architecture centered on Asia and countering China, and thus has downplayed the importance of the Middle East more broadly, questioning the value of maintaining U.S. military bases in Syria and Iraq.

The top Middle East civilian leader at the Pentagon, Michael Dimino, appears to hold a similar worldview. Dimino has written for the Quincy Institute’s web publication, Responsible Statecraft, on how bombing one’s way out of the Middle East won’t be productive and on the need to apply pressure on Israel to get more aid to Palestinians. “I do think international law has a role to play here,” Dimino told an interviewer about Gaza in November 2023. “I think that the importance of humanitarian aid getting into Gaza and holding our partners accountable, including Israel, on following the laws of armed conflict and the Geneva Conventions, all of that, is really important.”

Secretary of State Rubio has long been close to Republican donor and pro-Israel hawk Miriam Adelson. So far, he has focused on Latin America policy and less so on Israel and Palestine. But Adelson spent $100 million on Trump’s 2024 campaign, and at some point she may want a return on that investment.

Other State Department appointees will likely be more focused on the broader Middle East region, yet their roles may evolve. Ambassador-designate to the United Nations Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) has been one of the more militant vilifiers of pro-Palestinian speech, and she led the charge against university presidents last year. “Antisemitism and anti-Israel hate will not be tolerated on American campuses,” she posted when Trump announced federal funding would be withheld from universities that have protests. She is also a supporter of Israeli expansionism.

In Israel, U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee embodies the evangelical view of Israel. Huckabee is a hardcore Christian Zionist who published a cartoonish The Kids Guide to Israel, which paints Arabs and Palestinians as anti-Israel. He has expressed support, if not enthusiasm, for the expansionist Greater Israel project, and dismissed the idea of Israel’s occupation outright.

But in recent weeks, Huckabee has toned down his rhetoric. “A lot of people don’t understand that there are many Palestinians who live within the boundaries of Israel,” Huckabee told the evangelical media broadcaster Joel Rosenberg in an interview, “who live quite successfully and who prosper, and they live in peace.” That hasn’t totally precluded Huckabee from saying somewhat scary things like “I think we will see something of biblical proportion happen with [Trump’s] leadership in the Middle East.”

Policy toward Syria and Lebanon remains a wild card. Joel Rayburn has been nominated to serve as assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs. A retired military officer shaped by the Iraq War who served in the previous Trump administration in a Syria envoy role, he will likely be leading on Trump’s approach to the post-Assad landscape, which will have major knock-on effects for Israelis and Palestinians, and which the administration has said precious little about so far. Witkoff’s deputy, Morgan Ortagus, is said to be handling Lebanon. She is a Republican operative who founded the Polaris National Security think tank and served in the State Department during Trump’s previous term. Her organization is very hawkish on Iran.

Pro-Israel voices are not just coming from the Adelson camp. “The hyper-online right,” as pundit Erick Erickson calls it, is another constituency on Israel policy. One influential figure may be Jacob Helberg, nominee for a senior economic post at the State Department who emerged from the military and surveillance tech company Palantir, which has been enthusiastically pro-Israel since the October 7 attacks. Helberg has disparaged Palestinian protesters, and played a big role in the campaign to mobilize Silicon Valley titans to support Trump.

Though Elon Musk appears largely focused on gutting government spending and regulations, one wonders whether he might end up playing an influential role on Israel policy. Over the years, he’s become a regular visitor to the country and its high-tech firms, which have played an integral role in the surveillance, targeting, and killing of Palestinians. Musk has also courted Gulf money—he spoke last year at the Saudi investment summit in Riyadh and sat in the front row of Trump’s Miami speech—and the potential business benefits of Trump’s policies may add more urgency to it as a priority. And Musk secretly met with Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations days after Trump won the election, which shows an interest in diplomatic action.

Also contributing to the conflicting range of views is Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, who has variously expressed hard-line pro-Israel stances and personally visited the now-ousted Syrian president in 2017 when he was widely considered a pariah and war criminal.

Son-in-law Jared Kushner has no formal role this term, and is just available as an adviser. But this time around, Trump’s kitchen cabinet is not strictly Zionist. Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman and the father-in-law of daughter Tiffany Trump, helped deliver Arab American voters and claimed a senior adviser role.

Trump’s instincts on the Middle East, like everything, can be surprising, which means sometimes he is much more critical of Israel than the typical Republican. The author Peter Beinart pointed out in a recent essay for Jewish Currents that early in the last term, Trump sought concessions from Netanyahu and was not hesitant in criticizing the Israeli leader. (I recently worked as interim editor at Currents.) But ultra-pro-Israel advisers in Trump’s inner circle, most notably Kushner, found ways to outmaneuver the president and ensure that the White House’s approach benefited Israel. As Beinart put it, “Even though Trump at times campaigned as a peace candidate who would end Israel’s wars in Gaza and Lebanon, this growing team clearly signals that he’s likely to help Israel make them even more brutal.”

TRUMP BARELY TOUCHED ON the Middle East in his address to a joint session of Congress, perhaps because he wanted to keep expectations low after the first phase of the Israel-Hamas cease-fire. He briefly said his priority was bringing back the Israeli hostages from Gaza. That contrasts with Netanyahu, who has committed to continuing the war, as analysts point out, because it’s politically useful for an Israeli prime minister facing corruption charges. In his remarks, Trump also said he’s intent on expanding normalization deals for Israel in the Arab region. He didn’t name Saudi Arabia outright, but that’s very much the goal, and Palestinians stand to lose the most.

Five years on, the accomplishment of the so-called Abraham Accords between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco that Trump’s team negotiated is that their diplomatic relations withstood Israel’s mass killing and war crimes. In lived experience for citizens of those three Arab states, the effects are rather limited. These countries were not at war with Israel, and already had many informal links. In a sense, they were more arms deals than peace deals; Israeli military contractors recently tabled at an arms expo in the UAE.

Some analysts have argued that ignoring Palestinians in the accords led to the October 7 attacks. The Biden administration overlooked the Palestinian issue from the outset and kept a single-minded focus on extending that normalization to Saudi Arabia. The Democratic president’s message for Palestinians was that of paltry economic peace for a people who, even before October 7, experienced in 2023 the most deaths of Palestinian children since the United Nations began counting, and no horizon for political change.

The enthusiasm for an Abraham Accord for Saudi Arabia has not dampened, despite the disastrous results in Gaza. Both the Trump I and Biden administrations floated unprecedented inducements for Saudi Arabia, including nuclear-enrichment technology for a civilian program and an extraordinary defense treaty that would offer the kingdom NATO-like protections. Now, Trump seems poised to offer these incentives and more in exchange for MBS establishing diplomatic relations with Israel.

Trump the bully, the strongman, may be able to achieve impressive ends through deplorable means.

Israeli tech ventures are particularly excited about doing more business in Saudi, but have already found ways to do just that, quietly developing extensive business and military ties: Israel has sold Saudi Arabia a dangerous cyber weapon; Saudi Arabia welcomed Israeli officials to visit the Kingdom. But I’ve been confused by how any of this would serve U.S. interests. Biden’s team said such an arrangement would firmly put Saudi Arabia in the U.S. camp and keep it away from partnering with Russia and China.

For what it’s worth, the great purveyor of foreign-policy realism, Henry Kissinger, wasn’t convinced the U.S. should offer Saudi Arabia so much. “I’m very uneasy,” he told the Council on Foreign Relations in early October 2023, in one of his last public appearances just days before the Hamas attack. “The idea that a third country should pay all the price, and another country should benefit, does not give you much hope for the sincerity” of the agreement.

The gold-standard offer, which for whatever reason has not been resuscitated two decades after its initial proposal, is the Arab Peace Initiative. The Saudi-backed opportunity would provide that all Arab states recognize Israel, in exchange for the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state. Thomas Friedman previewed the idea from MBS’s predecessor in a New York Times column back in 2002, and it’s still one of the most sensible solutions to all this.

MBS did not set out to be the savior of Palestine, but he may decide that such a role would be in his own personal interest and a way to shore up support among his constituencies. He’s evolved on this issue and has called Israel’s offensive a “genocide.” That MBS hosted the first meeting between top Russian and American diplomats since the 2022 start of the Ukraine war suggests the crown prince prizes geopolitical power and maintains some leverage over Trump.

Avoiding another conflagration may make Trump willing to put pressure on Netanyahu to get some accommodation for Palestinians, though what MBS may be asking for—Palestinian statehood—is likely not on offer from the Israelis. But it’s an ill fit with Trump’s Gaza Riviera plan. If that was the opening salvo for Mr. Dealmaker, then what does it mean in practice? Bizarrely, it may be a call for the Palestinians to speak up. Coates, now the vice president of the Heritage Foundation, argued at the recent panel that the Palestinians excluded themselves in Trump’s first term; this time, she argued, they would be better served by coming to the table.

“The question about what we’re going to do about a one-state, a two-state, a three-state, a four-state solution is ultimately going to be up to the Palestinians,” Coates said. “I have said this to every Palestinian that will talk to me over the course of the last eight years: You have your most leverage now; you should use it. President Trump expects you to use it. He expects you to negotiate on your behalf, but you have to engage to get there.”

Somehow, optimism for a pragmatic approach remains despite the “crazy video,” according to an Arab American Republican in Trump’s orbit. His approach is “all about real estate, land, land swaps—land, land, and more land,” they told me. “And it’s about using the negotiation tactics that they’ve learned in their real estate deals to get a peace deal. Both sides have got to give up something to get something. No buyer’s remorse here, you know, haggle until you get to an agreement.”

I was frankly surprised by how sanguine this individual was, considering the brashness of Trump’s remarks, but they saw it as a positive development that the Gaza Riviera comments had already jolted the Arab League into action. Their expedited response to Trump reflected the real possibility of popular uprisings spreading across the region in response to the violent displacement of Palestinians and in solidarity with Palestinian rights. It’s not overstating the case to say that Trump could weaken the already brittle regimes in Egypt and Jordan simply by continuing to repeat his comments.

Support for Israel, as evidenced by the rushed arms transfers, will continue, though that hasn’t yet alienated his high-level Arab American supporters. “I think in the president’s mind, he feels that a secure Israel is an Israel that is capable of making peace,” Bahbah, the Palestinian American campaigner for Trump, told me. But the Arab American base seems much less willing to put up with the president’s rhetoric.

The impact may be more visceral on the ground. “This was obviously one of Trump’s signature negotiating tactics. But that doesn’t mean Israel is walking it back,” explained Tariq Kenney-Shawa of the think tank Al-Shabaka. “Israel continues to telegraph their intentions to move forward with the ethnic cleansing of Gaza by ensuring that it remains unlivable.” The abysmal humanitarian situation demands our attention, all while the Gaza-fication of the occupied West Bank is ongoing, with intensive Israeli military operations and displacement of 40,000 Palestinians.

The failure of the peace process industry in Washington and the Democrats under Biden and Obama to make any significant progress on Israel-Palestine has created a remarkable opening for Trump, and one that he will likely exploit most of all on the proposed Saudi normalization deal. Of course, real estate is a factor as well, one that may work to Trump’s advantage. “They’re all trying to build up their wealth. Look at how, how far, the UAE has come. Saudi has these plans to have tourist resorts and that big city that they’re building, Neom. This all gets in the way,” the former Trump White House official told me. “The Palestinian issue mucks it all up for them, and so they just want it to go away.”

THE FOCUS ON MIDDLE EAST DIPLOMACY and stated commitment toward a Saudi-Israel deal doesn’t mean that the Trump administration won’t nonetheless turn toward militarism. Hard power appears all-important to the president; see his brazen comments on taking over the Panama Canal and Greenland. And though Trump paid lip service toward peace in the campaign, he has often suggested bombing as a solution, reaching for military answers to political problems. Contradictions abound: He may withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq or Syria while reaching for military options in other scenarios. He has already ordered airstrikes on Iraq, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen.

Trump keeps coming back to “peace through strength,” which incidentally is also a favorite mantra of Netanyahu’s. Some Trump advisers may champion similar chest-thumping to Biden’s team on Israel, with its proclamations that Israel is in its best regional position ever, given the assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leadership. This has led to a new hubris around Israel being able to shape the whole Middle East through military outcomes.

But as analyst Omar Rahman of the Middle East Council on Global Affairs explains, Israel’s military strength is unlikely to translate into much. “Even the United States, with all its power, resources, money, and 20 years of occupation in Iraq and in Afghanistan, was unable to determine the outcomes it wanted to see in both of those countries, as the global superpower,” Rahman told me. “So how’s Israel just dropping American-made bombs going to do anything but engender more radicalism and extremism and hate for both Israel and the United States?”

A serious concern is whether Trump would be willing to blow up the Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, or the treaty between Israel and Jordan. Rahman notes that Egypt continued its relations with Israel despite the Sabra and Shatila massacres during the Lebanese civil war, and both countries maintained relations throughout the second Intifada. Now, leaders of the UAE have indicated that none of Israel’s obliteration of Gaza has gotten in the way of their Abraham Accord with Israel.

Trump the bully, the strongman, the unpredictable leader who wants peace, perhaps only for his own benefit or for the glory of a Nobel Prize, may be able to achieve impressive ends through deplorable means. He may get countries to accommodate his desires, however irrational, because they don’t want to confront him. He may also leave Israel unrestrained, especially in its military campaigns in Syria and the West Bank.

All of this presents a strange opportunity to refocus on what American interests actually are in the Middle East. Though Trump himself is more Trump First than America First, some advisers are genuinely focused on advancing U.S. interests in the Middle East. There do seem to be enough realists and pragmatists in the administration that Trump may surprise, as he did with the short-lived Israel-Hamas cease-fire. There’s not really space for true optimism, but diplomacy and cease-fires are good things that serve American interests.

Even if Mideast diplomacy is centered in Witkoff’s office, there will be bigger arguments over the presence of American troops, how to engage with Iran, and what a future for Palestine might look like. Witkoff’s visit to Gaza and his colleague, hostage envoy Adam Boehler, talking directly with Hamas shows that his office has both the buy-in and the armor to engage in ways presidential envoys haven’t in recent memory. Beginning a conversation with Iran, for example, could open up further opportunities.

This isn’t to give the president the benefit of the doubt, as so many Republicans have as they trip over themselves to interpret his sometimes grotesque remarks through a policy lens. Progressives may find the administration’s occasional tendency toward realism in the Middle East to be advantageous to American interests, but that should not preclude criticism of policies that cause immense harm, like the immediate halt of humanitarian and development assistance, or the likely imminent implementation of a new Muslim ban.

One key lesson of both Trump’s first term and Biden’s time in the White House is that ignoring Palestine—disregarding the significance of Palestinian rights and its resonance throughout the Arab world—comes at everyone’s peril. Palestinians have to decide what happens to Gaza.",,https://prospect.org/world/2025-03-31-trump-factor-middle-east/,,,us,,news,,,,,,5,9,,5,,,prospect.org,,,,,,,,neutral,0.5366400480270386

Submerged Vehicle Carrying Four US Soldiers Recovered In Lithuania

Search and recovery efforts at training site in Lithuania where 4 US soldiers went missing during NATO exercises.

Rescue teams have recovered a submerged military vehicle in Lithuania that was carrying four US soldiers who remain missing.The M88 Hercules armored vehicle was retrieved early March 31, six days after a rescue operation was launched at the Pabrade military training ground near Lithuania's border with BelarusLithuanian Defense Minister Davile Sakaliene said that the fate of the four soldiers has yet to be determined.“We cannot speak about it at the moment because, first and foremost, there is still no information about it and even once we get information, there's a strict agreement that the Americans will be the first to make any announcements,"" Sakaliene told Lithuanian public radio on March 31.

Trump Warns Iran Of ‘Bombing,’ Tariffs After Tehran Rejects Direct Nuclear Talks

US President Donald Trump warned Tehran after its president rejected direct nuclear talks.

US President Donald Trump threatened Iran with measures ranging from fresh sanctions and tariffs to military action after the country's president rejected holding direct talks with Washington over its rapidly expanding nuclear program.“We’ll see if we can get something done. And if not, it’s going to be a bad situation,” he told reporters on March 30 while flying to Washington from Florida.“I would prefer a deal to the other alternative, which I think everybody in this plane knows what that is, and that’s never going to be pretty,” he added.

With Proxies Weakened, Iran Banks On Missiles For Deterrence

Earlier, Trump had warned that ""if they don't make a deal, there will be bombing, and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.""He also said he was considering imposing tariffs on countries that buy oil from Iran as part of his “maximum pressure” strategy against Tehran.Earlier in the day, Iranian President Masud Pezeshkian publicly rejected holding direct negotiations with Washington over its nuclear program, something that had been proposed in a letter from Trump delivered to Tehran earlier this month.“Although the possibility of direct negotiations between the two sides has been rejected in this response, it has been emphasized that the path for indirect negotiations remains open,” Pezeshkian said.

Public Anger Rises As Iran's Economy Worsens

While high-ranking Iranian officials had previously spoken against the idea of holding nuclear talks with the United States, Pezeshkian’s comments mark Iran’s first formal rejection of the US call for negotiations.In response, the US State Department said that “President Trump has been clear: The United States cannot allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon.""“The president expressed his willingness to discuss a deal with Iran. If the Iranian regime does not want a deal, the president is clear: He will pursue other options, which will be very bad for Iran,” it added.Since Trump returned to the White House, his administration has consistently said that Iran must be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons and they have previously warned that military action is on the table should Iran reject Trump’s outreach.Pezeshkian’s remarks now help set the stage for a further rise in tensions between Tehran and Washington over the country’s nuclear program.Iran has long maintained that its program is for peaceful use, but Iranian officials have also threatened to pursue a weapon as tensions amid a growing standoff with the United States over sanctions and renewed bombing in the Gaza Strip following the collapse of a cease-fire in Israel’s war against Iran-backed Hamas, which is deemed a terrorist organization by the United States and the EU.A report in February by the UN’s nuclear watchdog said that Iran has accelerated its production of near weapons-grade uranium.

IAEA Warns About Iran's Accelerated Uranium Production

An Emirati delegation delivered a letter to Tehran from Trump proposing nuclear talks with the United States earlier this month, but hours before it arrived Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had already dismissed the prospect of talks with the Trump administration.Similar comments were made by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi on March 27 when he said that Tehran had sent a formal written response to Trump via Oman which maintained that Iran will not hold direct negotiations as long as Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign is in effect.“This official response includes a letter in which our position regarding the current situation and Mr. Trump's letter has been fully explained to the other party,” Araqchi said.In his televised comments, Pezeshkian offered the most direct acknowledgement yet that Tehran has rejected direct talks, although he left the door open for indirect negotiations with the United States and trust-building efforts.

Iran's President Publicly Rejects Trump's Letter Calling For Nuclear Negotiations

“We don’t avoid talks; it’s the breach of promises that has caused issues for us so far,” Pezeshkian said. “They must prove that they can build trust,” he said, referring to the United States.Iran’s economy has been reeling from years of sanctions, particularly after Trump, in his first term, pulled the United States out of a landmark nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sanctions.Tehran is looking to find ways to ease those sanctions or have them removed entirely, but the public rejection of Trump’s letter could lead to new pressure from Washington and other powers who are worried about Iran's nuclear program.With the 2015 nuclear deal set to formally expire in October 2025, world powers that are still part of the pact have just a few months before they lose the ability to reimpose UN sanctions on Iran.With reporting by the Associated Press and Reuters

Trump Threatens Putin With Oil Tariffs, Pressures Zelenskyy On Minerals Deal

US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters on a flight to Washington on March 30.

US President Donald Trump threatened Russia with new tariffs on oil products if Moscow blocks his cease-fire initiatives, while he also said Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy faces “big, big problems” if he doesn’t sign a key minerals deal with Washington.""He's trying to back out of the rare earth deal, and if he does that, he’s got some problems, big, big problems,"" Trump told reporters on March 30 in reference to the Ukrainian president.“We made a deal on rare earth. And now he’s saying, well you know, I want to renegotiate the deal.""""He wants to be a member of NATO, but he's never going to be a member of NATO. He understands that,"" Trump added.

On March 28, the Ukrainian government said it was still considering a draft agreement from the United States on the country's rare earth minerals amid media reports Washington had changed the terms of the deal several times.Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko announced at a government meeting that Kyiv was forming its position on the agreement, but lawmakers would only state their stance once there was consensus. Before then, she said, public discussion would be harmful.Ukraine possesses significant deposits of critical minerals, including rare earths, although their exact size remains uncertain. Rare earth minerals are highly valued for their use in defense technologies, as well as in devices such as computers, smartphones, and batteries.

From Dayton To Riyadh: Can Shuttle Diplomacy End the Ukraine War?

Ukraine and the United States earlier this month agreed to conclude a comprehensive agreement for developing Ukraine's critical mineral resources. Efforts to seal the deal had earlier fallen apart on February 28 after a heated exchange between Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House.Meanwhile, earlier on March 30, Trump said he would impose secondary tariffs of 25-50 percent on all Russian oil if he feels President Vladimir Putin is blocking his efforts to end the war in Ukraine.During a phone interview with NBC news, Trump said he was “very angry” and “pissed off” when Putin called for a transitional government to be put in place in Ukraine, which could effectively push out Zelenskyy.“If Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia’s fault -- which it might not be -- but if I think it was Russia’s fault, I am going to put secondary tariffs on oil, on all oil coming out of Russia,” Trump said.“That would be that if you buy oil from Russia, you can’t do business in the United States,” Trump said. “There will be a 25 percent tariff on all oil, a 25- to 50-point tariff on all oil.”Trump added that the trade measures would be put in place within a month if no cease-fire agreement is reached.The highly sensitive diplomatic juncture comes after the White House announced on March 25 that both Russia and Ukraine agreed to a cease-fire and to allow navigation in Black Sea, as well an agreement to not strike each other energy facilities.Kyiv says that it would take effect immediately and Moscow has stated that it would follow the partial lifting of sanctions pertaining to Russian companies and banks involved in the international food trade.Tougher Tone Towards PutinThe comments by Trump mark a shift from the softer approach the White House had taken toward Russia since the US president made ending the war in Ukraine a top foreign policy priority. They also come after he had previously criticized Zelenskyy, saying he was “sick” of his handling of the war and called him a ""dictator without elections.""Trump told NBC that he will speak with Putin during this week.Meanwhile, in his nightly video address on March 30, Zelenskyy said that ""Russia's response to the American proposition of unconditional cease-fire are drones, bombs, artillery shelling, ballistic missiles on a daily basis; Putin is demonstrating that he doesn't give a damn about diplomacy.""""What is needed are tougher sanctions against Russia, more air-defense capabilities for Ukraine, and more unity among our partners,"" Zelenskyy added.Amid the US-led diplomatic efforts to reach a cease-fire deal, Kyiv accused Moscow of a ""war crime"" on March 30 after Russian drones struck a military hospital.The overnight strike hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, as part of an attack that also hit a shopping center, apartment blocks, and other targets, killing at least two people according to authorities.The Ukrainian military’s general staff accused Russia of “violating the norms of international humanitarian law” in the attack, which they denounced as “deliberate, targeted shelling."" They added on March 30 that casualties included servicemen undergoing treatment in the medical center.

An hour before the Kharkiv attack, Zelenskyy said that Kyiv expected a strong response from Western countries to the near daily Russian drone attacks on its territory.“Our partners should clearly understand: These strikes are not just attacks on Ukrainian civilians, but also on all international efforts -- on the very diplomacy we are trying to use to end this war,"" Zelenskyy said on March 29 in his previous video address.In addition to the attacks on Kharkiv, Ukrainian authorities said that Russia fired a ballistic missile and launched drones as part of a barrage that also hit the cities of Dnipro, Kryviy Rih, and Poltava.

Myanmar Earthquake Death Toll Tops 1,700 As Fears Mount Of Rising Casualties

Commuters drive past a building that collapsed in the aftermath of the strong earthquake in Mandalay, Myanmar. 

The death toll from the powerful earthquake that struck Myanmar on March 28 has risen to over 1,700, with fears that the number could soar in the coming days. The 7.7-magnitude quake -- one of the strongest the war-torn country has experienced in a century -- also shook neighboring Thailand, causing damage and fatalities there.The quake in Myanmar left around 1,700 dead, 3,400 injured, and more than 300 missing as of March 30, the Southeast Asian country’s military government said.International aid agencies also warn of an expanding humanitarian crisis in the earthquake's aftermath. ""The destruction has been extensive, and humanitarian needs are growing by the hour,"" the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said in a statement, warning that there was “an urgent need to stabilize” the situation ahead of the monsoon season before secondary crises emerge.Rescue workers in Myanmar are continuing to search for possible survivors in the rubble of collapsed buildings, and the country’s military leadership has declared a state of emergency across six regions and allowed hundreds of foreign rescue personnel into the country to assist with the quake’s devastating aftermath.The junta chief, General Min Aung Hlaing, warned that the number of fatalities could go up and his administration faced a challenging situation, state media reported, days after he made a rare call for international assistance.India, China, and Thailand are among Myanmar's neighbors that have sent relief materials and teams, along with aid and personnel from Malaysia, Singapore, and Russia.Myanmar’s military government is locked in a fight with insurgents, a situation that could hamper the rescue and relief operation.The opposition National Unity Government said that anti-junta fighters under its command would pause all offensive military actions for two weeks as of March 30.Critical Infrastructure Severely DamagedAcross the country of 55 million, critical infrastructure -- including bridges, highways, airports, and railways -- has been severely damaged, hampering humanitarian operations.The quake comes on top of an already dire situation in a county wracked by a conflict that has battered the economy, displaced over 3.5 million people ,and debilitated the health system.In some areas near the epicenter in central Myanmar, residents told Reuters that government assistance was scarce, leaving people to fend for themselves.The U.S. Geological Service's predictive modelling estimated Myanmar's death toll could top 10,000 and losses could exceed the country's annual economic output, Reuters reported.Hospitals in parts of central and northwestern Myanmar, including the second-biggest city, Mandalay, and the capital Naypyitaw, were struggling to cope with an influx of injured people, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said late on March 29.

The quake also shook parts of neighboring Thailand, triggering the collapse of an under-construction skyscraper in Bangkok and killing at least 18 people across the capital, according to local authorities.As of March 30, at least 76 people remained trapped beneath the rubble of the collapsed building, where rescue operations continued for a third day on March 30, using drones and sniffer dogs to hunt for survivors.With reporting by Reuters

""American citizen Faye Hall, just released by the Taliban, is now in the care of our friends, the Qataris in Kabul, and will soon be on her way home,"" said Khalilzad, who has been part of a US team seeking the release of hostages held by the Taliban.The development came a week after George Glezmann, 66, was released from detention in Kabul following the first visit by a senior US official to Afghanistan since the Taliban seized power in the wake of the withdrawal of international troops in August 2021.Hall had been detained in February while with a British couple in their 70s, Barbie and Peter Reynolds.British media said the Reynolds had been operating school projects in Afghanistan for 18 years and had remained in the country despite the Taliban’s return to power.Reuters quoted a US official as saying Adam Boehler, Washington's special envoy for hostage affairs, had worked with Qatari officials and others to win Hall’s release.There was no immediate information on the British couple. Their daughter has pleaded for their release, citing health concerns.Several Americans are still detained in Afghanistan.Upon his release, Glezmann also thanked Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and others who helped free him.

Amsterdam Stabbing Rampage Suspect Is From Ukraine, Police Say

A Dutch police officer on March 27 looks on as a medical helicopter arrives in Amsterdam after stabbing attack that injured five.

Police in the Netherlands said on March 29 that a man suspected of a stabbing rampage that wounded five people in Amsterdam is a Ukrainian national from the eastern Donetsk region.The 30-year-old man is suspected of using multiple knives to randomly stab five people in a busy shopping area in central Amsterdam on March 27 and is set to appear in court on April 1, police said in a statement.The motive for the attack remains unclear, and the investigation remains ongoing, police said.Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Heorhiy Tykhiy said Kyiv’s Embassy is “close contact with the law enforcement agencies of the Netherlands” and seeking additional information.He added that the embassy is attempting to determine how the suspect arrived in the country and that it plans to work closely with Dutch authorities.""We wish a speedy recovery to the victims. Such violence has no justification, and the perpetrator must be held accountable,"" Tykhiy added.Two US citizens -- a 67-year-old woman and a 69-year-old man -- were among the victims of the attack, as were a 26-year-old man from Poland, a 73-year-old Belgian woman, and a 19-year-old woman from Amsterdam, police said.They said the Polish man had been released from hospital, while the other victims remained hospitalized but in a stable condition.Police said in the statement that the man checked into an Amsterdam hotel on March 26, the day before the attack. They did not release further details about his identity or arrival in the country.A bystander wrestled the assailant to the ground during the attack and held him until police arrived.Much of the Donetsk region, where Dutch police said the alleged assailant hails from, is occupied by Russia following the Kremlin’s armed incursion into eastern Ukraine in 2014 and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that Russia launched in February 2022.With reporting by Reuters and AP

Myanmar Quake Death Toll Crosses 1,600, Scores Still Missing

Rescue workers in the Myanmar capital, Naypyitaw, attend to an injured man who was trapped under a building following an earthquake on March 28.

The death toll of a 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar has climbed to more than 1,600 amid fears that the casualty figures will continue to rise in the war-torn nation and in neighboring Thailand.Myanmar’s military-run government said on March 29 that 1,644 people were killed in the earthquake that rocked the region a day earlier, while authorities in Thailand said at least 10 people have been found dead so far.The toll of those injured rose to 3,408, while the number of those missing increased to 139.Rescue workers in Myanmar on March 29 continued to search for possible survivors in the rubble of collapsed buildings, and the country’s military leadership allowed hundreds of foreign rescue personnel to enter to assist in the effort.The country’s junta government declared a state of emergency across six regions and its isolated leader, General Min Aung Hlaing, said earlier on state television that he had invited ""any country"" to provide help and donations.Myanmar’s military government is locked in a fight with anti-junta insurgents, a situation that could hamper the rescue and relief operation.A spokesman for the opposition National Unity Government said earlier that fighters from the anti-junta militias known as the People's Defense Forces would provide humanitarian help.Historic City At EpicenterAccording to the US Geological Survey, the earthquake occurred at around 1:30 p.m. local time at a depth of 10 kilometers near Mandalay, the second-largest city in Myanmar. It was followed 11 minutes later by a 6.4-magnitude aftershock.The tremors left buildings, bridges, and roads wrecked in the epicenter, Mandalay, an ancient city of about 1.5 million people, residents and local media said.Reuters cited an unnamed resident as saying that destruction stretched across the entire city, leaving it with no electricity and disrupted phone lines.

Thailand’s capital, Bangkok -- located more than 600 miles from the epicenter -- was declared a disaster zone after the quake sent high-rise buildings swaying.Thailand's deputy prime minister, Anutin Charnvirakul, said authorities had mobilized all possible resources in the search for survivors and to retrieve the remains of the deceased.""We always have hope,"" Charnvirakul told reporters. ""We're still working around the clock.""Thailand's state-owned operator of the country's airports said in a statement on March 29 that operations at six airports -- including in Bangkok and Phuket -- had returned to normal operations and safety inspections.With reporting by AP, AFP, and Reuters

Civilians Killed In Pakistani Drone Strikes Targeting Militants

 The latest deadly incident comes amid a rise in violent attacks in Pakistan’s strategic region bordering Afghanistan and Iran. (file photo)

Multiple civilians, including women and children, were killed in a Pakistani military operation targeting militants in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, a provincial official said.Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif, a spokesperson for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, said in a March 29 statement that nine members of a family were killed unintentionally in the operation the previous day in the mountainous Katlang area of the province’s Mardan district.“Several wanted terrorists were successfully targeted during the operation,” Saif said, adding that civilians living nearby, including women and children, were also killed.Local residents told RFE/RL’s Radio Mashaal that the victims, originally from Swat Valley, had been living in isolation in the Katlang area. They claimed the victims were killed as a result of military drone strikes on the family’s makeshift tent.The incident sparked public outrage, with relatives and local residents staging a protest and temporarily blocking the Swat Motorway -- a major route leading to the Swat Valley -- to condemn the killing of civilians.Mardan district police spokesperson Fahim Khan told Radio Mashaal that the bodies had been transferred to the district headquarters hospital for post-mortem examination, and that investigations into the incident are ongoing.An unidentified police source was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying earlier on March 29 that the Pakistani military carried out three drone strikes targeting ""Pakistani Taliban hideouts"" in the region.Violence On The RiseThe operation comes amid a rise in violent attacks in Pakistan’s strategic region bordering Afghanistan and Iran.The extremist Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Islamic State-Khorasan groups are behind an escalating insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.Earlier on March 29, a Pakistani intelligence official told Radio Mashaal that at least seven soldiers and six suspected militants were killed during a separate military operation in the province.The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the media, said five soldiers were also injured in the clash in the province’s Lakki Marut district and had been taken to a military hospital in the city of Bannu for treatment.The official did not identify which militant group was involved in the clash, but AFP cited an unidentified police source as saying the operation targeted “armed Taliban” fighters.Since the Taliban's return to power in Afghanistan following the US withdrawal in 2021, violence by both TTP militants and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist militant group pursuing Balochistan's secession from Pakistan, has been on the rise.BLA militants claimed responsibility for an unprecedented attack earlier this month with the hijacking of a passenger train with more than 400 people on board.

Fate Of More Than 100 Pakistani Train Hostages Unknown Amid Contradictory Claims

The Pakistani military previously claimed to have killed 11 suspected militants in four separate operations and clashes in North Waziristan and Dera Ismail Khan on March 26-27.Radio Mashaal was unable to independently verify that claim.Police in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province said in a report released on March 19 that, in the first 10 weeks of this year, there were a total of 68 attacks on police, in which a total of 26 soldiers were killed.

What's Behind The New Wave Of Violence In Pakistan's Balochistan?

The Pakistani government says it is committed to fighting terrorism.In a March 23 speech, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said the nation and its security agencies are ""united"" against terrorism and will not allow militant groups to achieve their ""unspeakable"" goals.Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who chairs Pakistan's National Security Committee, said on March 18 that the government should respond to terrorism with ""full force.""With reporting by AFP

Russian Drone Attack On Ukrainian City Of Dnipro Kills 4, Injures 25, Governor Says

Dnipro residents inspect the aftermath of a Russian drone strike on the Ukrainian city late on March 28.

A Russian drone attack on the southeastern Ukrainian city of Dnipro late on March 28 killed four people and sparked a large fire in a hotel and restaurant complex as well as multiple private homes, the regional governor said.""According to the information we have at the moment, there are four deaths in Dnipro,"" said Serhiy Lysak, governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, on Telegram.Russian forces used more than 20 drones in the strike on Dnipro, which also injured 25. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a pregnant woman was among the injured.""Russia mocks the world’s peace efforts -- dragging out the war and committing these acts of terror because it still doesn’t feel real pressure,"" Zelenskyy said in his X post on March 29.Lysak said a high-rise apartment building and nearly 10 private homes had caught fire. The blaze in the hotel complex has been brought under control, he said.Pictures and videos posted on social media showed flames and large plumes of smoke in the air. Others showed shattered buildings, the badly damaged upper floors of a high-rise apartment block, and streets strewn with smashed glass and pieces of buildings.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha called the attack ""Putin’s response to US cease-fire proposals.""Elsewhere on March 29, at least seven people were injured in a missile strike on Kryviy Rih, Ukraine’s state emergency service said in a statement.The attack also damaged residential buildings, a store, a car wash, and an infrastructure facility along with more than 20 cars.Meanwhile, Ukraine’s armed forces on March 28 reported that a strike carried out the day before in the Bryansk region of Russia destroyed the military infrastructure of a checkpoint. The Ukrainian Air Force struck the Pogar border checkpoint in the locality of Sluchovsk in the Bryansk region, the General Staff of the Armed Forces said.In addition to the military infrastructure, the strike destroyed the checkpoint’s means of communication and electronic warfare as well as a video surveillance system, according to the Ukrainian military. Casualties among personnel are preliminarily estimated at 15 to 40 Russian servicemen, the General Staff said.It was not possible to verify the claims.

The Military And Monetary Impact Of Ukraine's Deep Strikes In Russia

The General Staff called the air strike a response to the Russian Army’s continued drone attacks on Ukrainian settlements, which destroy civilian infrastructure and kill Ukrainian citizens.""It is known that Russian [drone] launches have been repeatedly recorded from the Pogar location. The destruction of the specified checkpoint reduces the enemy's potential for conducting combat operations against units of the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the Sumy region and in the Kursk direction,"" the command said in a statement.The Russian Defense Ministry did not report a strike on the Pogar checkpoint. The governor of the Bryansk region announced a strike on an agricultural enterprise in the area the day before.

Key Takeaways From The US Talks With Ukraine And Russia In Riyadh

Meanwhile, amid a series of US-led talks aimed at establishing a lasting truce between Kyiv and Moscow, US Vice President JD Vance said on March 28 that he sees ""an incredible amount of progress"" being made toward a peaceful resolution of the war in Ukraine.""We make sure that what we're seeing from one party is met by the other party and vice versa [...] For the first time in four years, thanks to President Trump's leadership we have an opportunity to really achieve a peaceful settlement,"" Vance told reporters while visiting the US military base at Pituffik in Greenland.With reporting by Reuters

RFE/RL Continues Lawsuit As It Awaits Funds; Judge Blocks Dismantling Of VOA

Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) is continuing legal action against the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM) to secure the release of congressionally appropriated funding, it said in a statement on March 28.USAGM oversees RFE/RL, Voice of America (VOA), and other US international media.The USAGM claimed to terminate RFE/RL’s grant on March 15, hours after an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump called for the reduction of seven agencies -- including the USAGM -- to “the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.”On March 26, USAGM wrote to RFE/RL saying that it was reversing the announcement but that this was “without prejudice to USAGM’s authority to terminate the grant.”RFE/RL’s lawsuit maintains that USAGM does not have this authority, since the grant was awarded by an act of Congress.A statement released by RFE/RL on March 27 said “RFE/RL awaits official confirmation from USAGM that grant funding will resume.”The new statement on March 28 made it clear that this had not yet happened.“We look forward to receiving the funds that Congress has appropriated to us through the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM). Until then, we will pursue all necessary legal remedies to ensure that Congressional intent is respected,” it said.The statement also said RFE/RL’s commitment to its audiences and congressionally mandated mission ""remains steadfast.”On March 25, a US court granted RFE/RL’s request for a temporary restraining order (TRO), ruling that USAGM had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” in terminating RFE/RL’s grant.The grant's termination was communicated in a letter signed by Kari Lake, who listed her title as “Senior Advisor to the (USAGM) Acting CEO with Authorities Delegated by Acting CEO.”After writing to RFE/RL on March 26, Lake continued to criticize RFE/RL and other USAGM entities.

VOA Sues Overseer USAGM To Restore Operations After Trump Order

“The question to the American people is do you want your hard-earned tax dollars going to this type of propaganda? I’m fighting it right now at the US Agency for Global Media and it’s going to be a battle,” she told Newsmax.In a subsequent interview on One America News, Lake said that she had not yet had time to review the journalism of USAGM entities.A federal judge in New York later on March 28 criticized USAGM's leadership, including Lake, for pulling the plug “seemingly overnight” on VOA and other news organizations run by the USAGM with “no consideration of the effects.”Judge James Paul Oetken's comments came in an order blocking the Trump administration’s efforts to dismantle VOA, calling the move a “classic case of arbitrary and capricious decision making.”Oetken faulted the Trump administration for “taking a sledgehammer to an agency that has been statutorily authorized and funded by Congress.""In a win for VOA, the judge issued a temporary restraining order barring the agency from “any further attempt to terminate, reduce-in-force, place on leave, or furlough” employees or contractors, and from closing any offices or requiring overseas employees to return to the United States.“This is a decisive victory for press freedom and the First Amendment, and a sharp rebuke” to the Trump administration’s “utter disregard for the principles that define our democracy,” said Andrew G. Celli Jr., a lawyer for VOA.Celli represents a coalition of VOA journalists, labor unions, and Reporters Without Borders that sued the Trump administration after Trump issued the executive order that cut funding to the USAGM and six other unrelated federal entities as part of his campaign to shrink government and align its with his political agenda.According to the lawsuit, VOA employees were told to finish their live broadcasts on March 15 then vacate the building. Soon after, the lawsuit said, they lost access to agency computer systems, including e-mail. VOA news website hasn’t been updated since.The plaintiffs argued that in the absence of VOA's programming “propagandists whose messages will monopolize global airwaves” is filling the vacuum.Trump and other Republicans have accused VOA of having a “leftist bias” and failing to project “pro-American” values to its worldwide audience, even though it is mandated by Congress to serve as a nonpartisan news organization.Lake, a former television journalist, has been especially harsh in her characterization of the content produced by VOA, RFE/RL, and the other news organizations.“We want to make sure that these agencies are in line with what our American values are. We’re telling America’s story. We’re not telling our adversaries’ stories.”“By God,"" she said, “we’re not going to be putting out anti-American garbage.”Separately on March 28, Radio Free Asia (RFA), another of USAGM's stakeholders, said it would shut down by the end of April if the courts did not prevent the Trump administration from cutting its funding.RFA has filed a motion to stop the USAGM's termination of funding and ensure access to funds appropriated by Congress.""The filing emphasizes the irreparable harm being done to RFA’s operations, its reputation, and its ability to protect journalists reporting from some of the most dangerous parts of the world,"" it said in a statement.""Without court intervention, RFA is expected to fully shut down by the end of April.""RFA said it has already furloughed 75 percent of its US-based staffed and suspended more than 90 percent of its freelance journalists.The agency has broadcast across Asia since 1996. Rights activists say its multilingual reporters provide reliable news in authoritarian countries, raising awareness about the plight of oppressed minorities such as Uyghur Muslims in China.With reporting by AP and Reuters

Lithuanian President 'Hopes For Miracle' As Search For US Troops Continues

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda (left) speaks to the media next to U.S. Ambassador to Lithuania Kara C. McDonald at the site of a rescue operation at the Pabrade training ground.

Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said he still “hopes for a miracle” as rescue crews continue work to recover a submerged military vehicle that was carrying four US soldiers who remain missing.Nauseda told reporters after he arrived on March 28 to survey the situation at the Pabrade military training ground near Lithuania's border with Belarus that while many sceptics ""would probably say there is nothing to hope for in these circumstances, I want to believe.""""I am still hoping for a miracle,"" he added.Rescue operations have been under way since the early hours of March 25, when four US soldiers in an M88 Hercules armored recovery vehicle went missing.Their vehicle was found submerged in a bog out in the training ground, triggering a massive recovery effort involving hundreds of Lithuanian and US personnel and dozens of vehicles.

Lithuanian Defense Minister Davile Sakaliene said the rescue operation was able to remove ""two to three meters of silt,"" but the vehicle was still not visible due to murky water.""It's still not enough, and water is rushing into the incident site from a nearby lake,"" she told LRT radio earlier in the day. She previously said the vehicle was located in water and mud at “more than 5 meters down.”Sakaliene said that the fate of the four soldiers has yet to be determined and that investigators have not ruled out the possibility that they are not in the vehicle, but elsewhere.On March 27, US Ambassador to Lithuania Kara C. McDonald visited the site of the search operation, pledging that US authorities ""will not rest until we find them.""Following the McDonald’s visit and the arrival of a team of US divers to the training ground, Sakalene said Lithuanians are “heartbroken” and “watching every moment of this rescue operation.”“Just as America doesn’t leave its own behind, we in Lithuania don’t leave ours behind either. And we consider these American soldiers our own,” she told Fox News on March 28.Lithuania, a NATO and EU member, hosts more than 1,000 US troops stationed in the Baltic nation on a rotational basis.US Army Europe and Africa said in a statement earlier that the four soldiers were ""conducting scheduled tactical training"" when they went missing on March 25.In the early hours of the rescue operation, several conflicting accounts emerged, including comments from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte that the four US soldiers were dead.A NATO spokeswoman later walked back those comments.Asked on the evening of March 26 by reporters if he had been briefed about the missing soldiers, US President Donald Trump said, “No, I haven’t.”He has not commented on the situation since.

After New US Push, Ukraine Is Still Considering Minerals Deal

Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said the government was still discussing the proposed agreement. 

KYIV -- The Ukrainian government said it is still considering a draft agreement from the United States on the country's minerals amid media reports Washington has changed the terms of the deal several times.Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko announced at a government meeting that Kyiv is forming its position on the agreement but lawmakers would only state their stance once there was consensus. Before then, she said, public discussion would be harmful.As the United States has been engaging in shuttle diplomacy to bring peace to Ukraine, US President Donald Trump said on March 24 that he expected the two countries would soon sign a minerals and natural resources deal.

Inside The Ukraine-US Minerals Deal (It's Not What You Might Think)

Speaking to Reuters, Mykhaylo Podolyak, a senior adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said that the draft agreement had yet to be finalized.The news agency said that, according to three people familiar with the talks, the latest draft gives Ukraine no future security guarantees and requires it to contribute all income from the use of natural resources managed by state and private enterprises to a joint investment fund.""Consultations are still happening at the level of the various ministries,"" Podolyak said.Ukraine possesses significant deposits of critical minerals, including rare earths, although their exact size remains uncertain. Rare earth minerals are highly valued for their use in defense technologies, as well as in devices such as computers, smartphones, and batteries.Recouping US SupportLast month, Ukraine and the United States reached a comprehensive agreement to develop Ukraine's vital mineral resources. The agreement was part of Trump's efforts to end the war and recoup some of the tens of billions of dollars the US has given Ukraine in financial and military aid since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.Following a contentious meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy at the White House on February 28, attempts to finalize the agreement collapsed.At the heart of the original deal was a joint fund that would be financed by future profits from the extraction of valuable minerals in Ukraine.

In Ukraine's Lithium Belt, Hopes That A Minerals Deal Will Bring An Economic Boom

It is not clear whether the terms of the minerals deal have changed or whether it will include the security guarantees for Ukraine that Zelenskyy has pushed for.The Ukrainian president said on March 27 that the United States was ""constantly"" altering the terms of the proposed agreement, though he added that he did not want Washington to believe that Kyiv was opposed to it.The London-based Financial Times reported on March 27 that the new draft agreement goes far beyond the first agreement and would cover all mineral resources, including oil and gas, and major energy assets across Ukraine.In comments on X on March 28, Svyrydenko said that, given the importance of the agreement, ""it is crucial for us to have a constructive dialogue with our American partners.""

Insisting On Indirect Talks, Iran Responds To Trump Letter Via Oman

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Iran's formal response to a letter from US President Donald Trump was delivered to Oman.

Iran said it has given a ""restrained"" response to a letter by US President Donald Trump proposing direct talks over a new nuclear deal, as Tehran continues to insist on indirect negotiations.Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on March 27 that Iran delivered its formal written response to Trump via Oman, maintaining that Tehran will not hold direct negotiations as long as Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign is in effect.""This official response includes a letter in which our position regarding the current situation and Mr. Trump's letter has been fully explained to the other party,"" Araqchi said.

Decision Time For Iran After Delivery Of Trump Letter

Trump’s letter was delivered to Iran by an Emirati official on March 12. Some observers have argued that Iran’s decision to reply via Oman was due to concerns over the relationship between the United Arab Emirates and Israel.Others, however, have pointed to Trump’s rapport with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that Israel will be made aware of the contents of Iran’s letter by Washington.

US Strikes On Yemen's Houthis A Message To Iran

Reports say Trump’s letter included a proposal for direct negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program and threats that failure to reach a deal would have severe consequences. Washington has not ruled out air strikes against Iran’s nuclear program.Indirect Talks A No-GoAli Shamkhani, a top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Tehran’s response was “restrained.”“It has been said in the letter that Iran is ready for indirect negotiations and if talks are held on equal footing, there is readiness to take further steps to negotiate,” said Shamkhani, a former national-security adviser.Ali Vaez, Iran Program director at the International Crisis Group, says Tehran’s insistence on indirect talks will not go down well in Washington because Trump cares about the optics of face-to-face negotiations.“Trump has no interest in indirect negotiations,” Vaez told RFE/RL’s Radio Farda. “Any indirect talks through mediators, no matter how good they progress, will be vulnerable.”Hossein Mousavian, a former Iranian ambassador to Germany, wrote on X that he believes Iran delivered “an ambiguous response” and “addressed all the key points in Trump’s letter.”

With Proxies Weakened, Iran Banks On Missiles For Deterrence

Vaez, however, criticized Iran’s negotiation tactics, arguing that decision-makers in Tehran “have no understanding” of how Trump operates.“You cannot be ambiguous with Trump and his representatives. This type of diplomacy doesn’t work with this administration,” he said, adding that Iran needs to table a clear proposal for direct talks.“Iran’s approach is a waste of time, and in the worst-case scenario, it’ll bring us to a dead-end where you can no longer have a peaceful resolution,” Vaez said.The Islamic republic insists its nuclear program is peaceful, but there have been growing calls among hard-liners to weaponize it.Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran during his first term in office, arguing that it did not go far enough to rein in Iran's threat, such as restricting its missile program and ending support for its regional proxies.Iran says it is willing to talk to lift US sanctions, but it has categorically ruled out talks over the missile program and regional activities.With reporting by Elaheh Ravanshad of RFE/RL's Radio Farda

U.S. Temporarily Restores Funding For War Crimes Research On Abducted Ukrainian Children -- Report

The US-funded research helped compile evidence that led to the 2023 International Criminal Court indictments of Russian President Vladimir Putin (left) and Kremlin children's advocate Maria Lvova-Belova (right). 

The United States has reportedly made a temporary reversal to cut a US-backed project to compile evidence of possible Russian war crimes related to the alleged abduction of Ukrainian children.The yearslong US-funded effort, which was spearheaded in part by Yale University, had helped pave the way for the International Criminal Court to issue indictments against Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin’s main children’s advocate.Yale researchers found that Putin and other top Russian officials were directly involved in an organized campaign to move children out of Ukrainian territories under Russian control, and move them into Russian summer camps and foster homes.It was done, researchers said, with little to no effort to identify the children’s parents or legal guardians.Earlier this month, the executive director of the Yale center, Nathaniel Raymond, told RFE/RL that the State Department was ending funding for the effort, something he called “a catastrophic blow"" to efforts to document war crimes.The Trump administration had also barred researchers from passing any of their evidence to the court's prosecutors. The White House has aggressively pushed back at The Hague court, all but declaring it to be illegitimate.This week, however, the State Department reversed its decision, The Washington Post reported, and provided 6-weeks of funding to allow researchers to transfer its evidence to the European Union’s law enforcement agency, EUROPOL.The State Department did not immediately respond to request for comment. Nor could Raymond be immediately reached.Responding to a reporter’s question in Washington on March 27, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that the administration had stopped funding the effort, but suggested that the database of evidence was intact and would be transferred “to the appropriate authorities.”“The data is secured. We secured the data,” Rubio said. “The program is not funded. It was part of the reductions that were made, but we secured the data and we’ve ensured that we have it and it can be transferred to any appropriate",,https://www.rferl.org/a/33365111.html,,,us,,news,,,,,,4,13,,5,,,rferl.org,,,,,,,,negative,0.9470590949058533

‘If they do not make a deal, there will be bombing,’ the US president told NBC News on Sunday.

He added: ‘There is a chance that if they do not make a deal, that I will do secondary tariffs on them like I did four years ago, that brought them to a position that they very much wanted to be.’

Iran’s leaders fired back, warning that ‘someone in a glass room does not throw stones at anyone’ – a clear reference to America’s military presence in the Middle East.

Iran fires back at Trump’s bomb threat

Commander of the IRGC Aerospace Force, Amir Ali Hajizadeh, said: ‘The Americans have at least 10 bases with 50,000 troops in the region, which means they are sitting in a glass room.’

With more than a dozen US bases in the region – all within Iran’s missile range – the exchange of threats has reignited fears that a miscalculation could spark a devastating war. 

As of October 2024, US defence officials said there were at least 43,000 servicemembers in the Middle East, many on ships at sea, according to the Council on Foreign Relations.

In total, the US has military facilities across at least 19 sites – eight of them considered to be permanent by many regional analysts – in countries like Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and the United Arab Emirates.

The US military also uses large bases in Djibouti and Turkey, which are part of other regional commands but often contribute significantly to missions in the Middle East.

Iran’s military arsenal largest in region

Meanwhile, Iran boasts more than 3,000 ballistic missiles, the largest arsenal in the Middle East, and has shown willingness to use them if it is pushed into a corner.

This arsenal does not include its burgeoning land-attack cruise missile force. 

Vast improvements have also been made over the past decade in the precision and accuracy of the missiles.

Many Iranian missiles are also inherently capable of carrying nuclear payloads, which has long been an international concern.

Timeline of nuclear fallout

The first steps of the fallout between Iran and the US were made during Trump’s first term in the White House, in 2017-2021.

A 2015 deal with global superpowers required Iran to limit its nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief. 

 The country has increasingly boasted of its underground ‘weapon cities’ (Picture: AFP)

But in 2018, the US leader withdrew, imposing sweeping sanctions.

It was after that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said that Iran had amassed enough fissile material for multiple bombs but had made no effort to build one.

On March 7, Trump said he had written to Khamenei, warning that he must either agree to fresh negotiations or face a military confrontation.

But Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian has ruled out direct negotiations with the Trump administration over the country’s nuclear programme.

Instead, he has signalled a willingness for ‘indirect talks’.

News,ng,post,303103760,2025-03-23,"Truth or Dare: How alcohol, drug-fuelled  game tears lovers apart, ruins trust Comedian and skit maker, Ganiyu Morufu, aka Ijoba Lande, left many mouths agape when he recently alleged that his wife, Dara, had cheated on him 21 times. According to him, she had had affairs with several powerful people in the entertainment industry.

In another interview, he alleged that he had a tape of actor, Babatunde Tayo, aka Baba Tee; as well as eight other men having sex (at different times) with his wife.

Though Baba Tee initially declined the allegation, he later backtracked and admitted that he had a brief (quickie) sexual encounter with Dara during a Truth or Dare session.

According to him, he met Dara when another actress, Marygold, brought her to his house and identified her as a content creator.

He revealed that he had sex with her while playing the game. In an online interview, he said, “When Marygold and Dara came to my house. She (Marygold) claimed that she wanted me to be an MC for an upcoming programme of hers despite not telling me that she was coming with anyone. She introduced Dara as a content creator, and not as Lande’s wife. They began to ask if I had a Qatar connection before the ‘Truth or Dare’ game suggestion came up.

“Immediately we began the game, Marygold went completely naked and was daring me consistently, while she kept taking alcohol as a choice of not wanting to do the tasks that I demanded from her. Rather than throwing more ‘Truth’ to me, they were hurling ‘Dare’ at me.

“Marygold now dared Dara to let me have a ‘quick’ sexual intercourse with her and she (Dara) obliged. So, the reason I said I never slept with Lande’s wife was because Marygold never introduced her as that to me, she called her a content creator. I will not deny that I had a short sexual intercourse with her, it is the first time I am saying it. It is now that I discovered that it was a set-up by both of them to malign my personality.”

He also admitted that alcohol and marijuana influenced their actions on that day.

Baba Tee’s admission raised a lot of eyebrows, and it also brought the issue of ‘Truth and Dare’ to the front burner.

The sex tape that shocked the nation

In April 2022, many watched with indignation as a female secondary school student barely in her teens could be seen on tape having sex in a room with three male classmates.

It was later reported that the act was preceded by a ‘Truth or Dare’ game in which the girl was “dared” to have sex with the male students.

The incident, which happened in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, sparked a lot of outrage, with many blaming the school authorities for failing to properly monitor the students who were in the city to represent their school in the World School Games held between March 10 and 13, 2022.

Though the mother of the pupil later claimed that her daughter was raped, the school authorities insisted otherwise.

The school maintained that the students took part in a Truth or Dare game “which led to the immoral act.”

Recalling how she got to know about the incident and the psychological impact it had on their family, the distraught mother of the female student had said, “A parent called me that she needed to see me urgently. I went to her house and she told me that something had been trending in Chrisland, and she believed I was not aware. The woman showed me the video and told me that all the parents were aware. Immediately, I informed my husband.

“When my daughter explained to me what happened, she said that they went out in the morning to have breakfast and one of the boys begged her to lend him her phone charger which she obliged. After they had dinner, the boy called her room that she should come and take her charger. She went there for her charger.

“When she got into the room, one of them said she should take her charger from the toilet; it was when she entered the toilet that they told her to take a substance, so they were all under the influence. She said after that, she did not know what she was doing again.

“Please, I am begging Nigerians to help me because Chrisland is trying to hide this issue. They are trying to push us out of the way and my daughter is affected psychologically. Please, I need help as a mother. I am begging fellow Nigerians to help me.”

Reacting to the incident, the National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools, released a statement blaming parental negligence for such acts.

“Parents are not usually present to monitor their children at home due to pressure from work and unending heavy vehicular traffic, especially in the city. This makes many parents leave home as early as 5:00 a.m. and return home from 9:00 p.m. So, there is no quality time with the children,” NAPPS president, Yomi Otubela, said.

From ‘Questions and Commands’ to ‘Truth or Dare’

According to www.truthordare.app, ‘Truth or Dare’ has its birthplace in England. Originally called ‘Questions and Commands’, the game was played by adults in the 16th century. Its purpose was to get people to confess their deepest secrets or perform outrageous tasks.

The website also noted that, “the earliest references to Questions and Commands appear in a 1677 French and English Dictionary by Guy Miege”.

It continued, “Truth or Dare is often referred to as a ‘daring game’ among street games for children, called ‘Roi qui ne ment’ in France in as early as 1345. It was even seen played at the party at Camp Laurence in the book, ‘Little Women’, published in 1868.

“Even back then, the game was a form of socialisation and creating bonds with others. Players were given the choice to either answer a thought-provoking question or perform a daring task.

“The game has also made its mark on the entertainment industry. American singer, Madonna, chose the game as the title of one of the songs in her 1991 documentary, ‘Truth or Dare’.”

Controversial singer, Habeeb Okikiola, aka Portable, who has shown himself to be quite prolific at making songs from trending issues, also released a song titled, ‘Truth or Dare’, which refers to Lande’s story.

A movie with the same name was also released in 2018, featuring American actors— Lucy Hale and Tyler Posey— as main characters who become involved in a sinister version of the game. The horror film takes the game to a whole new level as players are hunted down by supernatural forces for refusing to do their dares.

Another website, www.origin.com added that the “adventure” the game promises is one of the main reasons behind its immense popularity among all age groups.

“As the game spread across the world, it started to take on different names like “dare, dare, double dare, kiss, truth, promise” in Australia, or “truth dare, double dare, love, kiss or promise” in England,” it said.

From childhood play dates to teenage hangouts, ‘Truth or Dare’ has indeed been a staple of social interaction for generations. However, in recent years, the game has taken on new life in Nigeria, particularly among young people; thanks to the power of social media. The combination of digital connectivity, shifting cultural norms, and an ever-growing desire for entertainment has transformed it from a simple party game into a full-fledged social phenomenon.

Traditionally, it was a game played at social gatherings, particularly among young people looking for lighthearted fun. The rules were simple: participants took turns choosing between answering a truthfully revealing question or performing a daring challenge. The game thrived in close-knit circles, where peer pressure and friendly competition heightened the excitement.

Back then, most people preferred to play such a “daring” game with people they had known for a long time, and who they were comfortable with. This was due to the fact that secrets could be revealed during those games, and there was ample chance that it could get pretty intense and intimate pretty quickly.

However, in the digital age, the game has evolved beyond the confines of living rooms and school premises. Social media platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, X, and Snapchat have amplified its reach, turning what was once a private pastime into a highly visible and interactive experience.

‘A game for the wild, daring’

Describing it as a game for the “wild and daring”, an X user, simply identified as DFaveGirl101ForReal, boasted that she had played the game several times, and even had sexual intercourse on one of those occasions.

In a chat with our correspondent, she said, “The game is not meant for everyone, and no one is forced to play it. If you know you cannot stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.

“I actually started playing the game when I was in SS3. Back then, the wildest dare was for you to kiss someone. But, when I got into the university, the game became more daring and interesting. I am an adventurous person, so I like things like that.”

Recalling the “wildest” dare she had ever carried out, the social media enthusiast said, “That happened when I was in the university. During a hostel party, we played the game and I was dared to have sex with a random guy. We were dared to have a quickie in the bathroom for five minutes. Without hesitation, I pulled the guy into the bathroom, and we had sex. However, the only regret I have about that incident was that it was unprotected sex, but we had both had a lot to drink and were not thinking straight.

“For several months after that, I panicked because I was worried I could have been infected with HIV/AIDS or another sexually transmitted disease. When I eventually did a test and found out I was ‘clean’, I vowed never to be that reckless again. I still play the game, but I make sure the ‘dare’ is not something that would be detrimental to me or my health.”

A bank worker based in Akwa Ibom State, Nsikak Bassey, noted that she played the game while in the university. Though it did not have any repercussion; for several years, she was haunted by the fear that what she described as a “moment of indiscretion” could come back to hurt her.

She told Saturday PUNCH, “I was in my second year in the university when I first played the game. As an introvert, I rarely went out and had never attended a party in school up until that point, though I had heard of many of them.”

Bassey added that though she initially did not want to attend the rave, she caved in under the intense pressure from her roommates, and decided to go.

According to her, when they got there, everything went fine, and there was enough to eat and drink.

“However, at some point, some guys in final year walked into the party and they complained that it was too boring.

“They then suggested that we should play some games. We first played charade games, where we had to guess different things. But after some rounds, they claimed that was also becoming boring. That was when one of them suggested that we should play ‘Truth or Dare’.

“Prior to that time, I had never heard of the game but some others seemed interested and excited, so I decided to play along.

“The rules were that anyone that would not tell the “truth” or carry out a “dare” would have to drink some alcohol.

“When it got to my turn, I was told to rub a guy’s hair and cheeks. Since it was a relatively mild act, I did it, even though I felt very uncomfortable.

“When it got to my turn again, I was told to “French-kiss” another guy, but I blatantly refused. I was then told to drink some alcohol, which I did.

“After that, I began to feel tipsy and more uninhibited.

“During the next round, another guy was asked to kiss me and fondle my breasts in the presence of everyone. I refused but the guy said he was ready to do it. The others put pressure on me and I eventually allowed him to do it.

“Though it felt weird, I also derived some sort of perverse satisfaction from the act, probably because of the alcohol I had taken.

“However, after the party, I started feeling guilty. And I prayed never to run into the guy again, or even any of those that attended the party.

“I was in the Faculty of Science, and when I learnt that the guy was in the Faculty of Arts, can you believe I never stepped foot in that faculty until I graduated? That was how guilty I felt. I also prayed that we never had any mutual friends or acquaintances. Though I never saw him again, his face is still etched in my memory. Thank God social media was not as prevalent as it is now, pictures or videos could have made it to the Internet and embarrassed me for life. How can it be heard that a pastor’s daughter participated in such an immoral game?”

‘Truth or Dare cost me my fiancé’ 

Unlike Fave Girl and Bassey, not everybody who plays the game leaves unscathed. If a Computer Science graduate and entrepreneur, Itunu Daramola (not real name), could turn back the hands of time, she would gladly reverse it to the day before December 17, 2015.

As a final year student of the University of Nigeria Nsukka, Enugu State, she was excited that she was finally going to graduate from the school, having spent four gruelling years studying for her degree.

Basking in the excitement of the period, she attended several parties thrown by different faculties and departments to celebrate their impending exit from the school.

One of the parties started on a high note like the others, but she didn’t know the outcome would change her life.

In her words, “It was a programme for final year students of a particular department, and everything was going fine. We had plenty to eat and drink, and being one that is quite lightheaded, I was already getting drunk. After the programme, we proceeded for the after party.”

It was while at the party that they played the ‘Truth or Dare’ game. She recalled that buoyed by the excitement, there were several wild dares. When it got to her turn, she was “dared” to “do whatever it takes to turn on” another guy in the party.

“With an unusual boldness fuelled by the alcohol, I promptly sat on the guy, and began to do a lap dance. He claimed that he was not aroused, and people in the crowd encouraged him to fondle my boobs. As he did that, I was also egged on to kiss him, and I did that. I was too drunk to notice that people were taking pictures and recording videos.

“The rest of that night was a blur, and it was my friend that filled me in on everything that happened the next morning. Barely 30 minutes later, I got a message from my fiancé who was based in the United States of America. It was a video of the Truth or Dare session at the party. He stated that his brother sent it to him, and that I had embarrassed him before his family members,” she said, the tinge of regret unmistakable in her voice.

According to her, though she begged him severally and sent several emissaries, he blatantly refused to even speak to her after that day, much less listen to what she had to say.

“That was how the trajectory of my life changed, because I was supposed to join him in the US after the National Youth Service Corps programme,” she sighed in pain.

“Everybody got to know about what happened, and I became a subject of mockery in school, church, neighbourhood, family and practically every other place. I was seen as a wayward girl who had a promising relationship with a good man, and threw it all away recklessly,” she continued.

Daramola added that she had to move away to another state, and practically start life afresh.

“I still haven’t got married but I think my heart has healed, though it took over seven years for that to happen. However, whenever I hear any mention of that game, I get filled with anger. I always advise young people to stay away from it.

“When I heard of the Lande story, I almost shed tears because it brought back painful memories. My man at the time also felt that I had betrayed him deeply.”

The role of social media

There is no gainsaying the fact that social media has played an immense role in the current boost in popularity that the game is enjoying.

Interestingly, the game has evolved with various twists on the different social media platforms.

With its short-form video format, TikTok has made it easy for users to record and share their dares, often leading to viral trends. Hashtags such as #TruthOrDareChallenge and #DareMe have gained traction at different times, encouraging users to participate in bold and creative challenges.

Many TikTok influencers have incorporated ‘Truth or Dare’ into their content, drawing in massive engagement from followers eager to see their favourite creators tackle daring tasks. The thrill of watching these challenges unfold in real-time has made the game more appealing than ever.

On X (formerly Twitter), the game has taken on a different form, with users participating in text-based versions of the pastime. Public figures and social media influencers often initiate ‘Truth or Dare’ threads, where followers are invited to ask or respond to questions and dares. These engagements often lead to viral moments, further cementing the game’s popularity in Nigerian digital culture.

Instagram and Snapchat Stories have become another hotspot for ‘Truth or Dare’ interactions. Through anonymous question features and interactive stickers, users can challenge their friends to reveal secrets or complete dares. The temporary nature of Stories allows for playful experimentation while reducing the fear of long-term repercussions.

The celebrity factor

Social media influencers and other celebrities have also played a significant role in popularising the game. Skit makers, including TikTok, Instagram and YouTube personalities, often incorporate the game into their content.

The game has been played on different seasons of the wildly popular Big Brother Naija reality show as well.

Gen Z phenomenon

People born between 1997 and 2012 are often referred to as Gen Z (or Zoomers). Beyond being a nomenclature for a specific demographic, that “title” has become associated with anyone who possesses a wide range of peculiarities including, but not limited to being non-conformist, tech savvy, bold, outspoken, opinionated, aggressive, rude, wild and irrepressible.

According to a psychologist, Dare Akindele, this age group has grown up in an era of hyper-connectivity, where digital interactions are just as significant as face-to-face encounters; thus several factors explain why they have embraced ‘Truth or Dare’ so fervently.

For many of them, the thrill of the game is in the spontaneity it offers. A 27-year-old digital analyst, who identified himself only as IK, told our correspondent that unlike scripted social media content, he likes the excitement and suspense the game brings.

“The game introduces an element of unpredictability. It thrives on spontaneity, offering people like me an escape from the curated perfection of online life. Whether it’s a funny dare or a scandalous truth, the game provides moments of unfiltered authenticity,” he said.

IK also noted that at a time when physical socialising had become less frequent due to factors such as busy schedules and economic constraints, the game served as a bonding tool. He told Saturday PUNCH, “Online versions of the game allow players to connect with friends and strangers alike, strengthening digital communities across Nigeria.”

A 22-year-old digital marketer, Chantel (surname withheld), argued that the game encourages self expression.

“It allows young people to express themselves freely, breaking away from societal taboos and traditional constraints.

“It also boosts creativity, because many dares require participants to think outside the box, enhancing their creativity and problem-solving skills.

“In a country where economic challenges and social pressures are prevalent, this game offers a lighthearted escape, and I don’t think that’s such a big deal,” she noted.

Impact on society

As far as a 47-year-old teacher and mother of three, Mary Ifijeh, is concerned, there is no positive side to the game.

She said, “The dares can become extreme, leading to uncomfortable situations or online shaming.

“With the game being played online, there is also a risk of sensitive information being exposed. Most of these young people don’t know what they are doing. And if they are not careful, many of them will sadly regret these private pictures and videos they are putting online in the name of social media content.”

Another teacher and Christian youth leader, Biodun Shonubi, was of the opinion that the game had a sinister undertone.

He told our correspondent, “My thoughts on the Truth or Dare game is that it’s a devilish game. It is not meant for children at all. Whether some people like it or not, the game has an undertone. People might look at it as just a game, but I feel it is orchestrated by evil people to lure people into doing bad things.

“I don’t see any reason you would be playing a game with somebody, and you would dare the person to do something nasty and evil; which the person would ordinarily not do. And in an attempt to be bold, they would go ahead to do it. Imagine if a person is ‘dared’ to punch someone, and the person punched dies. Does that not become a police case?”

Shonubi stated that though he had never experienced the children around him playing the game, he actively discouraged it.

He recalled that when the game went viral, he and other teachers sentitised the youth around them.

“We told them about the dangers in the game, so that they would not be lured into playing it, and even if they had heard about it before and were planning to play it, they would have a change of mind.”

He also insisted that there was no positive side to the game. “Some people claim that it makes one bold. Bold to do what? It makes people bold to do something negative. I advise parents and teachers to teach their children about the evil inherent in that game,” he said.

Shonubi further admonished parents to be “alive to their responsibilities”, and guide their children appropriately.

A social media expert, Femi Aladeloba, was of the view that with advancements in technology and the continued influence of social media, the game would likely evolve even further.

“However, there is a need for a balance between fun and safety,” he cautioned.

He stressed that parents, educators and influencers should play a role in guiding young Nigerians on responsible participation.

According to him, content moderation and awareness campaigns could help mitigate the risks associated with extreme dares and online exposure.

A psychologist, Ruth Ibaka, noted that the game could have both positive and negative psychological effects on young people, particularly in the areas of risk-taking and peer pressure.

According to her, the “truth” and “dares” did not always have to be negative.

She said, “The game can push players out of their comfort zones, encouraging them to take social and sometimes physical risks.

“This can build confidence and reduce social anxiety, as they become more comfortable being the centre of attention or doing silly tasks.

“However, it can also normalise impulsivity if dares become reckless, leading to risky behaviour in real-life situations.”

Ibaka also cautioned that the game could reinforce peer pressure. “Since players often don’t want to seem weak or boring,” she opined. “They could feel pressured to accept dares that make them uncomfortable. The desire for social acceptance can lead to crossing personal boundaries, which may later contribute to difficulty saying “no” in other situations, such as substance use and unhealthy relationships,” she said.

Reflecting on the long-term effects, the psychologist who has three teenage children, said, “If played in a supportive and respectful environment, it can build resilience and confidence.

“However, if the game becomes toxic or exploitative, it may reinforce poor decision-making or a fear of standing up to peer pressure.”",,https://punchng.com/truth-or-dare-how-alcohol-drug-fuelled-game-tears-lovers-apart-ruins-trust/,,,nigeria,,news,,,,,,3,8,,6,,,punchng.com,,,,,,,,negative,0.998633086681366
News,ng,post,298181696,2025-03-09,"MDAs, Presidency spend N1.9bn on trips, training in France Ministries, departments and agencies of the Federal Government, alongside the Presidency, spent at least N1.99bn on foreign trips, training and estacodes in France between May 2023 and September 2024, Sunday PUNCH reports.

The findings are based on an analysis of data from GovSpend, a transparency platform by BudgIT that tracks public expenditure.

The funds covered airfare, hotel accommodation, visa processing, estacodes, training programmes and business meetings.

A substantial portion was spent on executive training programmes, study trips and international conferences.

One of the largest single expenses was N626.91m, paid by the Office of the Special Adviser to the President on Niger Delta for the training and type rating of 35 cadet pilots in South Africa, France and Nigeria.

The funds were transferred from the GIFMIS platform to the PAP Naira Transit Account at the Central Bank of Nigeria.

The State House also recorded heavy spending on foreign trips, including N149.79m for foreign exchange purchases for the First Lady’s trip to France on April 1, 2024. Another N6.29m was allocated in March 2024 for the processing of a five-year multiple-entry visa for the Vice President.

Several MDAs incurred significant expenses on overseas trips. The National Merit Award spent N15.5m as an advance payment for course fees for eight participants in a Paris training programme from 14 to 20 May 2023.

The Centre for Management Development spent N34.3m for six of its officials, each receiving N5.71m, to attend training in France.

Some top officials were also beneficiaries of these foreign trips. The Director-General of the Federal Institute of Industrial Research, Oshodi, Adamu Jummai, and the former Director-General of the National Directorate of Employment, Nuhu Fikpo, were among those whose trips were fully funded for executive programmes in Paris.

The Nigeria Communications Satellite Limited spent N41.09m on multiple officials, including the Technical Adviser to the NIGCOMSAT CEO, Temitope Yoosuf, for business meetings with Airbus in Toulouse, France.

Jane Egerton-Idehen, its Chief Executive Officer, and Aisha Bantam, Head of Corporate Affairs at NIGCOMSAT, were also funded with N11.88m and N5.65m, respectively, to attend the World Space Business Week in Paris.

The Nigeria Football Federation spent N124.45m on flight tickets for Super Falcons players travelling between America, France, Spain and Nigeria for their Olympic Games qualifier against Ethiopia.

Other notable payments include N10.62m by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission for airfare for three officials attending the G20 Anti-Corruption Working Group meeting in Paris.

The Fiscal Responsibility Commission also paid N7.90m for an officer to attend the 2023 International Bar Association Conference in France.

The Federal Ministry of Health paid N5.30m each for David Beine Atuwo and Olusola Ayoola to participate in the 11th EDCTP Forum in France, covering airfare and conference participation. 

The Defence Intelligence Agency made two significant payments, totalling N574.52m, for the salaries of two seconded staff of the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit at Interpol in Lyon, France, and Egmont Group in Ottawa, Canada.

The spending comes amid growing concerns over government expenditure and the rising cost of governance.

With the economy grappling with high inflation, fiscal deficits and a weakening naira, there have been calls for greater accountability and transparency in public spending.

The PUNCH earlier observed that in Tinubu’s first six months in office, specifically between June and December 2023, the State House spent not less than N3.4bn on both his local and foreign travels.

Similarly, in the first three months of 2024, a total of N5.24bn was spent by the State House on local and foreign travel expenses of the trio of Tinubu, Shettima and First Lady Remi Tinubu.

A sum of N1.35bn was spent as provision for presidential trips and other related expenses between January and March, N3.53bn was expended for the purchase of foreign currencies during 10 international trips, and N637.85m was disbursed to two travel agencies for the purchase of air tickets for presidential local and foreign trips.

It was also reported that major opposition parties have faulted Tinubu’s frequent travel abroad. According to them, the President is more interested in globetrotting than addressing pressing issues in the country.

But the presidency said a leader who sought to bring foreign investments couldn’t afford to sit back when the harvest was out there.

A few months ago, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yusuf Tuggar, justified President Bola Tinubu’s frequent travel abroad, saying he needs to embark on more trips because of its inherent benefits.

When reminded that Nigeria doesn’t have the money required for such frequent trips, the minister disagreed.

“Nigeria has the money. How much does travelling cost compared to the benefits? Again, how much does it cost really when you compare it to some of the things that the President has already addressed?

“How much have we wasted on fuel, electricity and other subsidies? He was subsidising consumption instead of production and subsidising the real sector of the economy,” he said.

In the past 21 months in office, Tinubu has visited about 19 countries on 32 foreign trips.

Among the countries visited were Paris, France; Malabo, Equatorial Guinea; London, the United Kingdom; Bissau, Guinea-Bissau; Nairobi, Kenya; Porto Norvo, Benin Republic; The Hague, Netherlands; Pretoria, South Africa; Accra, Ghana.

Others included New Delhi, India; Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates; New York, the United States of America; Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Berlin, Germany; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Dakar, Senegal; and Doha, Qatar.",,https://punchng.com/mdas-presidency-spend-n1-9bn-on-trips-training-in-france/,,,nigeria,,news,,,,,,1,10,,11,,,punchng.com,,,,,,,,negative,0.9845527410507202

According to CBS News, the 22nd Amendment, ratified in 1951, explicitly states that ""no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice."" This limit was established after President Franklin D. Roosevelt's unprecedented four consecutive terms.
Any attempt to remain in office would be legally suspect, and it is unclear how seriously Trump might pursue the idea.
The comments nonetheless were an extraordinary reflection of the desire to maintain power by a president who had violated democratic traditions four years ago when he tried to overturn the election he lost to former President Joe Biden, as per CBS News.
Trump's comments have been met with fierce criticism, with Rep. Daniel Goldman labeling it an ""escalation in his clear effort to take over the government and dismantle our democracy."" Goldman urged Congressional Republicans to oppose Trump's ambitions.
""If Congressional Republicans believe in the Constitution, they will go on the record opposing Trump's ambitions for a third term,"" he said.

This official response includes a letter in which our position regarding the current situation and Mr Trump's letter has been fully explained to the other party, Abbas Araghchi told the official IRNA news agency.He added that the letter was delivered to Oman, which has served as an intermediary in the past in the absence of US-Iranian diplomatic relations.He did not disclose the nature of the response nor say when it had been sent.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, asked by reporters on his plane over the Caribbean whether the United States has received the letter, said: I'm not going to comment on that yet .He said that the United States had expected there to be a response and obviously at that point, the president will decide what steps if he any he wants to take next .Trump, who in 2018 pulled the United States out of an agreement to relieve sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear programme, now says he is open to diplomatic talks.The US president revealed at the start of March that he had sent a letter to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.At the same time, Trump has pushed ahead with his maximum pressure programme of additional sanctions on Tehran and the threat of military action if it refuses to negotiate. Our policy remains not to negotiate directly (with Washington) under 'maximum pressure' and the threat of military action, but indirect negotiations, such as those that took place in the past, can continue, Araghchi said.Intermediaries Iran and the United States have not had official diplomatic relations since 1980.However, the two countries have engaged indirectly via the Swiss embassy in Tehran, which represents US interests in Iran.Oman has also played the role of mediator in the past, as has Qatar, to a lesser extent.Trump's letter was delivered to Iran by the United Arab Emirates.Iran agreed to the deal curbing its nuclear programme in 2015 after negotiations with major powers including the United States and China.Western government have for decades suspected that Tehran is pursuing a nuclear weapons capability, a charge that Iran denies, insisting that the programme is solely for civilian purposes.

News,in,post,303464092,2025-03-24,"Opinion: Israel May Be Planning To Occupy Gaza Indefinitely The number of people killed in Gaza in the Israel-Hamas war reached a new milestone over the weekend. More than 50,000 people have now died, including 15,613 children, according to figures released by Gaza's health ministry on Sunday. Nearly 700 Palestinians have lost their lives since last Tuesday, when Israel restarted lethal air strikes in Gaza last week. Both Israel and the US have blamed Hamas for the new offensive, which has ripped into a fragile ceasefire that had largely held since it came into effect in January. (function(v,d,o,ai){ai=d.createElement(""script"");ai.defer=true;ai.async=true;ai.src=v.location.protocol+o;d.head.appendChild(ai);})(window, document, ""//a.vdo.ai/core/v-ndtv/vdo.ai.js"");Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the military was asked to take action against the “terrorist” group after its ""repeated refusal to release our hostages"" as well as its rejection of US proposals. But many question the true intentions of Netanyahu. The first phase of the ceasefire ended on March 1. In the second phase, Hamas was to release the remaining 59 hostages—35 of them believed to be dead—in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal. But Israel never started negotiations for the second phase. US envoy Steve Witkoff put forward his new ""bridging proposal"" that would have extended the expired first phase. He proposed that more hostages would return home in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners. But, crucially, negotiations over a permanent end to the war would be delayed. That was not acceptable to Hamas, and Israel walked out of the ceasefire agreement. The New Israeli OffensiveHas Netanyahu's government restarted its bombing campaign because of Hamas refusing to free the remaining hostages, or is it due to issues he is facing at home? Is this move an attempt to implement a long-held agenda of the far-right in Israel to occupy Gaza permanently, reestablish Israeli settlements there, or even implement President Trump's plan to expel Palestinians from the territory and make it a “riviera of the Middle East?” Last Friday, Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, said he had instructed the military to seize additional areas of the Gaza Strip while issuing evacuation orders for Palestinian civilians in those areas to build up pressure on Hamas. “If the Hamas terror organisation continues to refuse to release the hostages, I instructed the IDF to capture additional areas, evacuate the population, and expand the security zone around Gaza for the protection of Israeli communities and IDF soldiers, through a permanent hold of the area by Israel…As long as Hamas continues its refusal, it will lose more and more land that will be added to Israel,” he said in a statement.If one looks at Katz's statement along with reports in the Israeli media, the Netanyahu government's plan for Gaza appears to emerge. Reports in the Israel media say the military chief, Eyal Zamir, is preparing for a full-scale ground offensive to reinstate military control in Gaza. “It seems that Israel is currently creating a smokescreen around the government and military's true intentions. While waiting for possible updates in negotiations, which are uncertain, preparations are underway for a large-scale operation to occupy Gaza and restore full Israeli control,” writes commentator Amos Hartel in Haaretz newspaper. “This will occur while the far-right factions in the government push for the return of settlements and the forced expulsion of Palestinians, to be presented as ‘voluntary migration', with backing from Donald Trump,” he adds.Will Israeli Settlements Return?Of course, Israel's far-right would like the reported plan to be implemented. They have been demanding for months that the Israeli settlements come back to Gaza (Israel had settlements in Gaza until 2005, which were removed after the government decided to pull back).Until recently, most analysts and commentators in Israel thought resettling Gaza was far-fetched. But not anymore. In October, two senior far-right Cabinet ministers, six lawmakers from Netanyahu's Likud party and several of his party's local leaders from across Israel attended a pro-settlement rally, where demands were raised for creating Israeli settlements in Gaza.But there is no evidence that a majority of the Israeli public is ready for such a plan, or even for a permanent occupation of Gaza. In any case, it is unlikely to make them more secure. Gazans are also not willing to leave the territory despite their unprecedented hardships since the Hamas-Israel war. Palestinians can't forget the “Nakba” of 1948, in which, following the founding of the state of Israel, about half of the civilians residing in Palestine were forced to leave their homes and never allowed to return. Many settled in Gaza. Growing Protests Against The PlanAs part of his plan, Trump has suggested that Arab countries—Egypt and Jordan, in particular—absorb the displaced population, while the United States would “own” the seaside territory. Arabs and even America's allies denounced the plan, which has been condemned as ‘ethnic cleansing' by global human rights groups. In Israel itself, tens of thousands of people across Israel have been staging protests against Netanyahu since last week. Protesters and his other critics have accused him of undermining democracy and restarting the war simply to divert attention from the political and legal problems he has been facing, thus jeopardising the fate of the remaining hostages. The immediate trigger for protests was Netanyahu's sacking of Ronen Bar, the head of Israel's internal security agency, Shin Bet (though this was later put on hold by a court while judges examined the evidence). The resumption of military action in Gaza fuelled their anger further. Netanyahu has accused Bar of failing to prevent the Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023, which resulted in 1,200 Israeli deaths and the abduction of more than 250 other Israelis, which triggered the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. It was the worst attack in Israel's history, sparking outrage not only in the country but across the globe. Ironically though, Netanyahu himself has not taken any responsibility for the horrific terrorist attack, which happened under his watch. Netanyahu's TroublesNo Israeli prime minister before Netanyahu has ever fired the head of a security agency during a war. His critics argue that the real reason behind the move appears to be investigations launched by Shin Bet against officials close to Netanyahu. The agency is probing a spokesperson who allegedly leaked to a German news outlet classified documents that appeared to give the prime minister political cover in ceasefire negotiations. Shin Bet is also looking into claims that Qatar reportedly hired close Netanyahu aides to launch a public relations campaign in Israel. Qatar had sent millions of dollars in cash to Gaza, with Netanyahu's approval. The assumption is that this money reached Hamas.Netanyahu's critics also point to his attempts to sack his Attorney General, Gali Baharav-Miara, who had said that the Israeli PM needed to clarify the legal basis for his decision to remove Bar, adding that “the role of the Shin Bet is not to serve the personal trust of the prime minister”.On Sunday, the Israeli cabinet voted in favour of a no-confidence motion against Gali Baharav-Miara, in a move designed to hasten her dismissal. In response, she said the government was seeking to place itself above the law and operate without checks and balances.Protesters are also concerned about judicial reforms that would introduce more political appointees to committees selecting judges. Netanyahu is already undergoing a corruption trial, for which he has been appearing in court. He faces charges related to fraud, bribery and breach of trust, though he alleges that they are politically motivated and fabricated by his opponents. Trump's PlaybookTaking a leaf out of Trump's book, a defiant Netanyahu says there has been a conspiracy against him by the ‘leftist deep state', just as Trump was being targeted in the United States. “In America and in Israel, when a strong rightwing leader wins an election, the leftist deep state weaponises the justice system to thwart the people's will. They won't win in either place!” he said in a post on X last week. But opinion polls show Netanyahu is now deeply unpopular in his country and might lose an election if it takes place now. He thus relies even more on far-right partners for his government to survive now. This could be one reason for his trying to appease them regarding the Gaza policy. Left In The LurchIsrael's brutal military response to the October 7 attacks by Hamas has resulted in devastating consequences not only for the militant group but also for Gaza's general population. Most of the leaders of Hamas and its ally, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, have been killed. Israel's other enemies, like Yemen-based Houthis and its sponsor Iran, are now much weakened. The regime change in Syria has also given a strategic advantage to the country. So, the parties supporting Hamas are either gone or are hardly able to threaten Israel anymore. With Trump in the White House, Netanyahu could not find a better ally in America. In contrast to his desperate attempts for a ceasefire in Ukraine, Trump doesn't seem keen to put an end to fighting in Gaza. Although he did pressure Netanyahu to agree on a ceasefire deal with Hamas in January, his support for Israel's new offensive suggests that he may still be hoping for his Gaza Riviera plan to succeed, regardless of what this could mean for Gaza's civilians. Unfortunately, Palestinians in Gaza don't have powerful backers, such as the European governments that have vowed to help another embattled population, the Ukrainians, even if the US abandons them. Even Arab governments, including Saudi Arabia, the host of the Ukraine ceasefire talks and the most powerful Arab nation, have not provided such support to the Palestinians.

News,in,post,303311916,2025-03-23,"World News | Legal Showdown Looms in Israel as Netanyahu Moves to Oust Top Officials Tel Aviv, Mar 23 (AP) Israel again is fighting a war on multiple fronts, but a battle is also brewing inside the country. Tens of thousands of Israelis have joined anti-government protests in recent days. A former Supreme Court chief justice has warned of civil war. And experts are saying a constitutional crisis could be on the horizon if the Israeli government moves ahead with plans to fire top legal and security officials. Also Read | Israel-Hamas War: Israeli Forces Push Deeper Into Gaza, Surrounding Rafah Neighbourhood. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced last week he was firing Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet internal security service, citing a crisis of confidence sparked by the failures to prevent Hamas' October 7, 2023, attacks. Netanyahu's government has also launched a process to dismiss the attorney general, accusing her of obstructing its agenda. Also Read | Canada Elections 2025: New PM Mark Carney To Kick Off Poll Campaign Amid Trade War and Annexation Threats From US President Donald Trump. The moves come as the Shin Bet is investigating a possible infiltration of Netanyahu's office by an Arab country and as Netanyahu is on trial for corruption. They are setting up a showdown between Netanyahu and the judiciary that is deepening divisions in Israel and could set off upheaval at a time when Israel is bogged down by war. Tensions between the government and state institutions Netanyahu's government launched a sweeping overhaul of the judiciary in early 2023, a process that touched off mass protests. Critics said the overhaul would undermine the country's delicate system of checks and balances by granting too much power to Netanyahu. He and his governing coalition argued the judiciary had become overly interventionist and was blocking its legislative agenda. Opponents also criticised Netanyahu for promoting the changes while on trial for corruption. They say a strong and independent judiciary is a necessary safeguard against authoritarian rule. Hamas' October 7 attacks, which sparked the war in Gaza, paused the overhaul. But it opened up new divisions in the country over who shouldered blame for not preventing the deadliest day in Israel's history. Netanyahu has sidestepped accepting responsibility, seeking instead to point a finger at the heads of the military and the Shin Bet. He has long blamed the “deep state” for wanting to topple his rule. In a surprise announcement last week, Netanyahu said he was dismissing Bar, sparking mass protests by critics who said the move would undermine Israel's independent state institutions and was meant as punishment for the Shin Bet's investigation into Netanyahu's office, or to derail it entirely. The step helped usher the far-right politician Itamar Ben-Gvir back into Netanyahu's government, bolstering the Israeli leader's rule ahead of a key budget vote. Ben-Gvir had resigned weeks earlier to protest a temporary ceasefire, and his return to office came hours after the resumption of the war in Gaza. Bar himself said he had planned to leave his post in due time, including after he wrapped up the sensitive investigations into whether the Gulf state of Qatar — which has close ties with Hamas — had hired Netanyahu advisers to launch an influence campaign in Israel. Netanyahu has suggested, with little evidence, that the probe was a result of collusion between Bar and the attorney general as a way to thwart the domestic security chief's dismissal. Netanyahu's government on Sunday voted to remove Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara, beginning a process that could take weeks. Disobeying the Supreme Court could bring chaos In a country with no official constitution and just one house of parliament that is controlled by Netanyahu's coalition, Israel's Supreme Court has long served as an important check on government decisions. The decision to dismiss Bar already has been challenged at the court, which issued an injunction that froze the move until further hearings. In the coming weeks, the court will be expected to rule on whether the dismissal was legal and whether there was a conflict of interest in light of the Qatar investigation. With the attorney general, the government passed a largely symbolic decision Sunday calling for her dismissal. A committee, which is expected to be stacked with Netanyahu's allies, will hear the government's and Baharav-Miara's positions before issuing a recommendation. Only then will Netanyahu's government make its final decision on her fate. If the committee goes ahead with her dismissal, it will likely face a challenge in the Supreme Court. Once again, it is expected to decide whether Netanyahu has a conflict of interest because he is firing the official who serves as the head of the public prosecution's office that is trying him for corruption. It is unclear whether the government would accept a decision it does not like. “The dangerous scenario is if they don't accept the ruling,” said Amir Fuchs, a senior researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank. That would prompt a crisis over which authority's rule should be followed — the court's or the government's -- and could lead to chaos, he said. Fears are mounting over internal strife Those fears have grown since the dismissals were set in motion. In a series of media interviews this weekend, 88-year-old Aharon Barak, Israel's preeminent legal mind, aired his concerns over the eruption of a potential civil war. He also joined nearly 20 former Supreme Court judges in a letter Sunday saying that firing the attorney general threatens the rule of law. Opposition leader Yair Lapid called for a tax revolt if the government disobeys the ruling. The leader of the country's top labor union said ignoring a court ruling was a red line, suggesting he might launch general strikes in response. The warnings have been eerily similar to 2023, when the legal overhaul was announced. Tens of thousands of people poured into the streets in sustained protests. General strikes were called and reservists threatened to not report for military service if the overhaul went ahead. Military service is compulsory for most Jews at the age of 18, but the army relies heavily on older reserve units, especially during wartime. Such internal strife was seen by some analysts as a factor in the timing of Hamas' attack. That upheaval could be just a precursor. “Disobeying the courts is an illegal act,” wrote commentator Nadav Eyal in the Yediot Ahronot daily. The result could be “widespread civil disobedience, the type of which the government will not survive.” (AP) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)",,https://www.latestly.com/agency-news/world-news-legal-showdown-looms-in-israel-as-netanyahu-moves-to-oust-top-officials-6730211.html,,,india,,news,,,,,,7,4,,6,,,latestly.com,,,,,,,,neutral,0.5725310444831848
News,in,post,303228730,2025-03-23,"Trump’s Surprise Gift For Taliban As US Lifts Bounties On Sirajuddin Haqqani And Two Others The US has lifted bounties on three senior Taliban figures, including the interior minister who also heads a powerful network blamed for bloody attacks against Afghanistan’s former Western-backed government, officials in Kabul said Sunday.
Sirajuddin Haqqani, who acknowledged planning a January 2008 attack on the Serena Hotel in Kabul, which killed six people, including US citizen Thor David Hesla, no longer appears on the State Department’s Rewards for Justice website. 
The FBI website on Sunday still featured a wanted poster for him.
Interior Ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani said the US government had revoked the bounties placed on Haqqani, Abdul Aziz Haqqani, and Yahya Haqqani.
“These three individuals are two brothers and one paternal cousin,” Qani told The Associated Press.
The Haqqani network grew into one of the deadliest arms of the Taliban after the US-led 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. 
The group employed roadside bombs, suicide bombings and other attacks, including on the Indian and US embassies, the Afghan presidency, and other major targets. They also have been linked to extortion, kidnapping and other criminal activity.
A Foreign Ministry official, Zakir Jalaly, said the Taliban’s release of US prisoner George Glezmann on Friday and the removal of bounties showed both sides were “moving beyond the effects of the wartime phase and taking constructive steps to pave the way for progress” in bilateral relations.
“The recent developments in Afghanistan-US relations are a good example of the pragmatic and realistic engagement between the two governments,” said Jalaly.
Taliban see the opening in breaking out of isolation.
Another official, Shafi Azam, hailed the development as the beginning of normalization, also citing the Taliban’s announcement they were in control of Afghanistan’s embassy in Norway.
Since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, China has been the most prominent country to accept one of their diplomats. 
Other countries have accepted de facto Taliban representatives, like Qatar, which has been a key mediator between the US and the Taliban. US envoys have also met the Taliban.
The Taliban rule, especially bans affecting women and girls, has triggered widespread condemnation and deepened their international isolation.
Haqqani has previously spoken out against the Taliban’s decision-making process, authoritarianism and alienation of the Afghan population.
He has been under UN sanctions since 2007, because of his involvement with the network founded by his father, Jalaluddin.
But the global body has allowed him to travel in the past 12 months, including to the United Arab Emirates to meet the country’s leadership and to Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage. Those were his first trips abroad since the Taliban takeover.
Ibraheem Bahiss, a senior analyst with International Crisis Group’s Asia program, said the removal of the bounties was a win for Taliban officials wanting to do business with the international community. The US was showing it could reward those who made compromises within their own remit, even if these compromises didn’t translate to national policy, he said.
The international community had made demands of the Taliban, specifically lifting restrictions on women and girls, but offered nothing in return, said Bahiss. Scrapping bounties was a sign that small diplomatic overtures were possible.
While recognition as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan might not immediately be on the horizon, the Taliban viewed normalization as enough progress given their existing diplomatic inroads in the region, according to Bahiss.
“For the Taliban, the removal of sanctions is more important than (official) recognition. Sanctions bite. They inhibit your ability to do business, to travel. That’s why they would celebrate this as a victory. The transactional nature of this diplomacy suits both the Taliban and Trump.”

The FBI website on Sunday still featured a wanted poster for him.Interior Ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani said the US government had revoked the bounties placed on Haqqani, Abdul Aziz Haqqani, and Yahya Haqqani.“These three individuals are two brothers and one paternal cousin,” Qani told The Associated Press.The Haqqani network grew into one of the deadliest arms of the Taliban after the US-led 2001 invasion of Afghanistan.The group employed roadside bombs, suicide bombings and other attacks, including on the Indian and US embassies, the Afghan presidency, and other major targets. They also have been linked to extortion, kidnapping and other criminal activity.Also Read: After Gaza, Israel Launches Multiple Airstrikes on Lebanon in Heaviest Fire Exchange Since Ceasefire with HezbollahA Foreign Ministry official, Zakir Jalaly, said the Taliban's release of US prisoner George Glezmann on Friday and the removal of bounties showed both sides were “moving beyond the effects of the wartime phase and taking constructive steps to pave the way for progress” in bilateral relations.“The recent developments in Afghanistan-US relations are a good example of the pragmatic and realistic engagement between the two governments,” said Jalaly.Taliban see the opening in breaking out of isolation Another official, Shafi Azam, hailed the development as the beginning of normalisation, also citing the Taliban's announcement they were in control of Afghanistan's embassy in Norway.Since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, China has been the most prominent country to accept one of their diplomats. Other countries have accepted de facto Taliban representatives, like Qatar, which has been a key mediator between the US and the Taliban. US envoys have also met the Taliban.The Taliban rule, especially bans affecting women and girls, has triggered widespread condemnation and deepened their international isolation.Haqqani has previously spoken out against the Taliban's decision-making process, authoritarianism and alienation of the Afghan population.He has been under UN sanctions since 2007, because of his involvement with the network founded by his father, Jalaluddin.But the global body has allowed him to travel in the past 12 months, including to the United Arab Emirates to meet the country's leadership and to Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage. Those were his first trips abroad since the Taliban takeover.Ibraheem Bahiss, a senior analyst with International Crisis Group's Asia program, said the removal of the bounties was a win for Taliban officials wanting to do business with the international community.The US was showing it could reward those who made compromises within their own remit, even if these compromises didn't translate to national policy, he said.The international community had made demands of the Taliban, specifically lifting restrictions on women and girls, but offered nothing in return, said Bahiss. Scrapping bounties was a sign that small diplomatic overtures were possible.While recognition as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan might not immediately be on the horizon, the Taliban viewed normalization as enough progress given their existing diplomatic inroads in the region, according to Bahiss.“For the Taliban, the removal of sanctions is more important than (official) recognition. Sanctions bite. They inhibit your ability to do business, to travel. That's why they would celebrate this as a victory. The transactional nature of this diplomacy suits both the Taliban and Trump.” His partial rehabilitation on the international stage is in contrast to the status of the reclusive Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, who could face arrest by the International Criminal Court for his persecution of women.(This story is not edited by Republic and is Published from a syndicated feed)",,https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/us-lifts-bounties-on-senior-taliban-officials-including-sirajuddin-haqqani-kabul,,,india,,news,,,,,,7,3,,7,,,republicworld.com,,,,,,,,positive,0.9888820052146912

The Delhi High Court launched an inquiry against one of its judges after allegations that unaccounted cash was found at his home. The Supreme Court said that a proposal has been made to transfer Justice Yashwant Varma to the Allahabad High Court, but maintained that discussions about the proposed transfer were not linked to the inquiry into the alleged cash haul.

Reports said earlier in the day that the cash was allegedly recovered when emergency services responded to a fire incident at Varma’s official residence on March 14. However, the Delhi fire services chief denied later on Friday that fire personnel found any cash during the operation. Varma has not commented on the matter so far.

Earlier in the day, the Allahabad High Court Bar Association opposed repatriating Varma to the Allahabad High Court, saying that it is not a “trash bin”. Read on.

The Karnataka speaker has suspended 18 Bharatiya Janata Party MLAs from the Assembly amid ruckus in connection with allegations of honey trapping made by a Congress minister. A day earlier, state minister KN Rajanna alleged that 48 politicians, including a minister, were honey-trapped in the state and that an attempt was made to trap him too.

When the Assembly session began on Friday, the BJP demanded a judicial inquiry into Rajanna’s claims, and sought a response from Chief Minister Siddaramaiah. Leader of the Opposition R Ashoka demanded an inquiry under a sitting judge of the Karnataka High Court.

Despite the chief minister promising a high-level investigation, BJP MLAs continued to protest seeking a judicial inquiry. Some BJP MLAs were seen throwing papers at the speaker’s chair, while some climbed the speaker’s dais.

Later, Speaker UT Khader suspended the 18 BJP MLAs, accusing them of indiscipline. Read on.

The Centre spent Rs 258.9 crore on 38 foreign trips made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi between May 2022 and December 2024, as per figures presented before the Rajya Sabha. The prime minister’s most expensive trip during this period was to the United States in June 2023, which cost more than Rs 22 crore, the government informed the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.

More than Rs 15 crore were spent on the prime minister’s September 2024 visit to the US.

The cost includes the expenditure on accommodations for the prime minister’s delegation, transportation, security and hardware, venue charges and “miscellaneous” expenses.

In 2022, Modi visited Germany, Denmark, France, Nepal, the United Arab Emirates, Japan, Uzbekistan and Indonesia. In 2023, Papua New Guinea, Australia, Japan, the US, the UAE, Egypt, South Africa, Indonesia and Greece were among the countries visited by the prime minister.

In 2024, the prime minister travelled to the UAE, Bhutan, Qatar, Italy, Austria, Russia, Poland, Ukraine, Brunei Darussalam, the US, Singapore, Laos, Brazil, Guyana and Kuwait. Read more.

A group of food and nutrition activists has demanded that a Union government advisory to reduce oil consumption in mid-day meals be withdrawn, describing it as unscientific. The collective, under the banner of the Right to Food Campaign, said that children need more, not less, healthy fats.

“In our experience, there are barriers for poorer communities to meet the recommended intake of fats and oils,” the activists said. They noted that the advisory came on the “heels of a statement by the Prime Minister [Narendra Modi] expressing ‘concern’ that childhood obesity is increasing among school children in India”.

The Union Ministry of Education, through the advisory issued on March 15, urged state governments to reduce the usage of cooking oil by 10% in the mid-day meal programmes under the Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti Nirman scheme. The centrally-sponsored scheme is aimed at providing nutritious meals to students enrolled in government and aided schools.

News,in,post,301180330,2025-03-17,"World News | Netanyahu's Bid to Oust Shin Bet Director Draws Coalition Praise, Opposition Outrage Tel Aviv [Israel], March 17 (ANI/TPS): Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to fire the head of the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet) drew praise from members of the governing coalition and fierce criticism from the opposition. No Shin Bet director has ever been dismissed in the middle of his term.
Political tensions climbed on Sunday when Netanyahu notified Shin Bet director Ronen Bar on Sunday that the Cabinet would vote to fire him in the coming days. After the meeting, Netanyahu said in a video statement, ""At all times, but especially during an existential war such as the one we face, there must be full trust between the prime minister and the head of the Shin Bet. But unfortunately, the situation is the opposite -- I do not have such trust. I have ongoing distrust in the head of the Shin Bet, a distrust that has grown over time.""
Also Read | PM Narendra Modi, New Zealand Counterpart Christopher Luxon Pay Obeisance in Gurdwara Rakab Ganj Sahib in Delhi (See Pics and Video).
But Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara said Netanyahu did not have the authority to dismiss Bar without a legal review.
She cited ""the extraordinary sensitivity of the issue, its unprecedented nature, the concern that the process may be tainted by illegality and conflict of interest, and considering that the role of the head of the Shin Bet is not a personal trust position serving the prime minister.""
Also Read | Donald Trump Administration Committed To Defeat Ideology That Drives 'Islamist Terrorism', Says US Intel Chief Tulsi Gabbard Ahead of Raisina Dialogue (Watch Video).
Further stoking the tensions, Bar initially released a statement saying Netanyahu did not listen to the Shin Bet's warnings.
The Shin Bet's internal investigation, said Bar, ""pointed to a policy that was led for years, with an emphasis on the year preceding the massacre, by the government and its leader. The investigation reveals a long and deliberate disregard by the political echelon for the organization's warnings.""
Bar's statement also said, ""The Prime Minister's expectation of a personal duty of trust whose purpose contradicts the public interest is a fundamentally wrong expectation that is contrary to the Shin Bet Law and contrary to the value of statehood that guides the General Security Service and its personnel.""
Opposition leader Yair Lapid called the move against Bar ""a loss of composure and a moral collapse."" Lapid also claimed the dismissal was motivated by the Shin Bet's investigation into two of Netanyahu's aides' ties with Qatar. ""For a year and a half he saw no reason to fire [Bar], but only when the investigation into Qatar's infiltration of Netanyahu's office and the funds transferred to his closest aides began, it suddenly became urgent to remove him.""
Justice Minister Yariv Levin insisted that Netanyahu had the authority to fire the Shin Bet director.
""The Shin Bet Law explicitly states that the government has the authority to terminate the service of the head of the agency before the end of their term. This law should be known to the attorney general as well. In case anyone is confused, Israel is a democracy, and everyone in it, including the attorney general, is subject to the law,"" Levin said.
The Shin Bet, Israel's domestic intelligence service, is responsible for counterterrorism, counterintelligence, internal security, VIP protection, and cybersecurity. The only Shin Bet director to ever resign before the end of his five-year term was Carmi Gillon in the aftermath of the 1995 assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
Otzma Yehudit party leader Itamar Ben-Gvir tweeted his support for Netanyahu, saying ""I commend the Prime Minister for the decision to dismiss the head of the Shin Bet. This is something I have demanded for a long time--better late than never. There is no place in a democratic state for officials who act in a politically adversarial manner against elected representatives.""
Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who appointed Bar as Shin Bet director in 2000, denounced the move.
""Mr. Netanyahu bears ultimate responsibility for the worst failure in Israel's history and should have resigned long ago,"" Bennett tweeted. ""His passive and defeatist policy has allowed Hamas and Hezbollah to build themselves into terror powerhouses on our borders for 15 years. As he wrote in his own book, even when I demanded the destruction of Hamas, he blocked it and even took pride in doing so.""
Bennett added that while several security officials ""took responsibility"" for the failures of Hamas's October 7 attacks, ""Netanyahu, on the other hand, is running away from his responsibility. The State of Israel will not be able to recover without his resignation.""
Most prominent among the resignations following the conclusion of the army's internal probes of the October 7 attacks was Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Herzi Halevi, who was recently replaced by Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir.
According to a series of army probes, some 5,000 terrorists from Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad managed to attack numerous Israeli communities and overrun the Israel Defense Force's border positions. The army's chain of command broke amid the chaos and soldiers were outnumbered. For years, the military misunderstood Hamas's intentions, and as October 7 approached, intelligence about the looming attack was misinterpreted, according to the findings.
The military's probes also found the military was more focused on threats from Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Iran.
The IDF's inquiries only dealt with issues of operations, intelligence and command, not decisions made by the political echelon.
There have been growing calls for the government to appoint an independent commission of inquiry to investigate political and military failures. Such commissions have broader authority to summon witnesses and collect evidence and are headed by a senior Supreme Court justice. They may include personal recommendations about individuals under investigation, though the government is not bound to act on them.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other government ministers say a state inquiry into failings that led to Hamas's October 7 attacks should only be held after the war. Critics accuse Netanyahu of delaying the inquiry and trying to water down the powers of a commission.
In respone to a legal petition filed by the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, the High Court of Justice ordered the government to update the justices on its position by May 11.
The last state commission of inquiry, which investigated Israel's worst civilian disaster -- a stampede that killed 45 people at a holy site on Mount Meron -- held Netanyahu personally responsible for the tragedy in a report released in April.
At least 1,180 people were killed, and 252 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas's attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the 59 remaining hostages, 36 are believed to be dead.

News,in,post,299373226,2025-03-12,"Top 10 Countries With Fastest Mobile Internet; See Where India Stands Global internet usage is still rising rapidly, and mobile internet is a key component of this digital revolution. However, there remains a noticeable disparity in internet speeds between nations, with Asia and the Middle East having the fastest connections.
Even though countries such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar are setting the benchmark for fast internet connections, nations like the United States and India still struggle to achieve high-speed mobile internet, mainly due to regional disparities and infrastructure constraints. The overall trend indicates increasing internet access and speeds, which will likely continue to drive the global digital transformation despite these challenges.
The Middle East and Asia frequently record the fastest mobile internet speeds, according to the Speedtest Global Index. For instance, the UAE tops the global rankings, with mobile internet speeds in Dubai, the country’s metropolis, increasing nearly 100 times. The United Arab Emirates has emerged as a global leader in internet speeds, largely due to sustained investments in digital infrastructure since 2012.
Top 10 Countries With The Fastest Mobile Internet

Qatar (358 Mbps):Qatar ranks second in the Middle East. Its significant investments in telecom infrastructure have ensured reliable mobile access and high-speed internet, particularly following the rollout of 5G services.

Kuwait (264 Mbps):Kuwait holds third place, largely due to the country’s early adoption of cutting-edge mobile technology and its subsequent expansion into 4G and 5G, ensuring consumers enjoy a fast and reliable internet connection.

Bulgaria (172 Mbps):Bulgaria is one of the top-performing European nations. A competitive telecom sector has made high-speed broadband and mobile services more affordable and accessible.

Denmark (162 Mbps):Denmark ranks fifth, thanks to significant investments in digital infrastructure and one of the strongest 5G networks in Europe, leading to improved mobile data speeds for consumers.

South Korea (148 Mbps):South Korea has long been a leader in internet rankings and mobile technology. With 5G networks now widely deployed nationwide, mobile internet speeds continue to rise, making South Korea one of the top nations for telecom infrastructure.

Netherlands (147 Mbps):Ranking just below South Korea, the Netherlands is known for its widespread adoption of 5G and robust mobile network services. It remains one of Europe’s most connected nations, offering fast and reliable mobile data.

Norway (145.74 Mbps):Norway boasts high-quality 4G and 5G networks, catering to a highly tech-savvy population that requires fast internet for both personal and business use.

China (139.58 Mbps):As one of the world’s largest economies, China has rapidly expanded its 5G networks. While rural areas still face some connectivity challenges, major cities experience high-speed, uninterrupted mobile internet.

Luxembourg (134.14 Mbps):Luxembourg completes the top 10 list with its fast mobile internet speeds. Despite its small size, the country has developed a strong mobile infrastructure and adopted cutting-edge technologies swiftly, ensuring seamless high-speed connections.

News,in,post,299063502,2025-03-11,"World News | China, Iran, Russia Hold Joint Naval Drills in Mideast as Tensions Rise Between Tehran, US Tehran, Mar 11 (AP) China, Iran and Russia conducted joint naval drills Tuesday in the Middle East, offering a show of force in a region still uneasy over Tehran's rapidly expanding nuclear programme and as Yemen's Houthi rebels threaten new attacks on ships. The joint drills, called the Maritime Security Belt 2025, took place in the Gulf of Oman near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all crude oil traded worldwide passes.

The area around the strait in the past has seen Iran seize commercial ships and launch suspected attacks in the time since President Donald Trump first unilaterally withdrew America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers. The drill marked the fifth year the three countries took part in the drills.

This year's drill likely sparked a warning late Monday from the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations centre, which said there was GPS interference in the strait, with disruptions lasting for several hours and forcing crews to rely on backup navigation methods. “This was likely GPS jamming to reduce the targeting capability of drones and missiles,” wrote Shaun Robertson, an intelligence analyst at the EOS Risk Group. “However, electronic navigation system interference has been reported in this region previously during periods of increased tension and military exercises.” China and Russia in Mideast waters patrolled by US Navy Russia's Defence Ministry identified the vessels it sent to the drill as the corvettes Rezky and the Hero of the Russian Federation Aldar Tsydenzhapov, as well as the tanker Pechenega. China's Defence Ministry said it sent the guided-missile destroyer Baotou and the comprehensive supply ship Gaoyouhu. Neither offered a count of the personnel involved. Neither China nor Russia actively patrol the wider Middle East, whose waterways remain crucial for global energy supplies. Instead they broadly cede that to Western nations largely led by the US Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet. Observers for the drill included Azerbaijan, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates — with the Americans likely keeping watch as well. However, both China and Russia have deep interests in Iran. For China, it has continued to purchase Iranian crude oil despite facing Western sanctions, likely at a discount compared to global prices. Beijing also remains one of the top markets for Iranian imports. Russia, meanwhile, has relied on Iran for the supply of bomb-carrying drones it uses in its war on Ukraine. Iran highlights drills to boost public support after Israeli attack The drills marked a major moment for Iran's state-run television network. It's aired segments showing live-fire during a night drill and sailors manning deck guns on a vessel. The exercises come after an Iranian months-long drill that followed a direct Israeli attack on the country, targeting its air defences and sites associated with its ballistic missile programme. While Tehran sought to downplay the assault, it shook the wider populace and came as a campaign of Israeli assassinations and attacks have decimated Iran's self-described “Axis of Resistance” — a series of militant groups allied with the Islamic Republic. Syrian President Bashar Assad was also overthrown in December, further weakening Iran's grip on the wider region. All the while, Iran has increasingly stockpiled more uranium enriched at near weapons-grade levels, something only done by atomic-armed nations. Tehran has long maintained its programme is for peaceful purposes, even as its officials increasingly threaten to pursue the bomb. Iran's nuclear programme has drawn warnings from both Israel and the US that it won't allow Tehran to obtain a bomb, signalling military action against the programme could happen. But just last week, Trump sent a letter to Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, seeking a new nuclear deal with Tehran. Iran says it hasn't received any letter, but still issued a flurry of pronouncements over it. Yemen's Houthis renew threats to Mideast waterways As a shaky ceasefire holds in Israel's war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Yemen's Houthi rebels have threatened to resume their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait that connect the two waterways. The rebels' secretive leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi warned Friday that attacks against Israel-linked vessels off Yemen would resume within four days if aid didn't resume to Gaza. That deadline came and went Tuesday. Though no attacks were reported, that again put shippers on edge. The rebels had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels in their campaign that has also killed four sailors.

News,in,post,298717298,2025-03-10,"Bridging the Gulf with AI: How India and GCC countries can leverage AI for mutual growth and innovation New Delhi, March 10 (SocialNews.XYZ) Recently, a few months back, the External Affairs Minister of India Dr S. Jaishankar paid his visit to Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to attend the first-ever India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting for Strategic Dialogue. During the meeting, EAM highlighted with great emphasis that the Gulf Cooperation Council as an entity has a vital significance for India and constitutes the “extended” neighbourhood for India.

The key milestone of the meeting was the adoption of a Joint Action Plan 2024-2028 for cooperating in various sectors such as healthcare, security, transportation, agriculture, energy, and food security. It was also decided that other areas of cooperation will also be included in the Joint Action Plan at later stages with mutually agreed-upon consensus.

In this regard, technology can be something very decisive in making this cooperation stronger and more equitable. Technologies, especially emerging technologies like AI, have the potential to contribute immensely to different sectors and drive inclusive growth and development. Interestingly, it is important to recognise that AI is the new frontier in the global technology landscape, where every country and group is vying to establish a stronghold. AI is no longer a buzzword in international politics, as it is transforming every aspect of modern society with far-reaching implications for the future. As India and the Gulf countries seek to enhance their strategic partnership, AI can play a pivotal role in fostering greater cooperation and driving mutual prosperity. The Gulf Cooperation Council, comprising Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Oman, has emerged as a key economic and strategic partner for India. Beyond the robust trade and investment flows, it is evident that there is a growing convergence of interests between India and the GCC on issues of regional security and counter-terrorism due to several geopolitical obligations. In this regard, building on the growing strategic convergence, AI can further deepen the India-GCC partnership.

One area where AI can significantly enhance India-GCC cooperation is in the field of supply chain management and logistics. Emerging AI-powered technologies like predictive analytics, autonomous vehicles, and robotics can optimise and streamline supply chain operations, leading to greater cost efficiencies and improved responsiveness. In the GCC region, countries like Oman are already exploring the adoption of AI in their logistics sector to drive future growth. Similarly, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar have made significant strides in embracing AI across various sectors. All GCC countries have come up with their own AI strategies and action plans to transform their economies and societies.

Saudi Arabia established the Saudi Data and AI Authority in 2019 to develop and implement the nation's AI strategy, and the UAE set up the Ministry of AI in 2017 and launched the National Strategy for AI 2031 to integrate AI into various sectors. Qatar also launched the National Artificial Intelligence Strategy in 2017 to integrate AI across sectors such as healthcare, education, and transportation. Similarly, Bahrain introduced guidelines in 2019 to promote responsible and ethical adoption of AI solutions across government agencies. Other countries in the GCC, such as Kuwait, partnered with Microsoft in 2019 to upskill government officials in leveraging AI and digital technologies, while Oman collaborated on AI projects for a Smart City Platform in 2020 to enhance traffic management, water efficiency, and waste management.

It is also important to note that India, on the other hand, has made significant strides in establishing itself as a global AI powerhouse. Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, India has outlined an ambitious National AI Strategy, which aims to leverage India's robust IT infrastructure and talented pool of engineers to position the country as a global leader in AI innovation. This signifies that India has tremendous potential to cooperate with GCC countries and help them accelerate their AI adoption and application.

Therefore, both India and the GCC countries can work together to harness the power of AI to address shared socioeconomic challenges and unlock new areas of growth. India can share its expertise in developing cost-effective AI solutions tailored to local needs, while the GCC can leverage its financial resources and infrastructure to scale up AI projects. Gulf countries have the financial resources and the willingness to invest heavily in advanced technologies to diversify their economies away from hydrocarbon dependence. By leveraging complementary strengths, India and the GCC can create a powerful AI alliance that drives innovation, solves regional challenges, and positions both as global leaders in the AI revolution.

The recently adopted India-GCC Joint Action Plan 2024-2028 provides a framework to deepen cooperation in AI and other emerging technologies. India’s foreign minister, S. Jaishankar, in his speech during the ministerial meeting, said that “the demands of AI, of electric mobility, and of green growth highlight the importance of sharing human resources.” In this regard, collaborative projects can lead to innovative AI solutions tailored to the specific needs of both regions, particularly in sectors like healthcare, smart cities, and agriculture. For instance, India’s expertise in software development and data analytics can complement the GCC's focus on infrastructure and urban planning. GCC countries can invest in Indian startups and research initiatives, fostering a vibrant ecosystem for AI innovation. This investment can create jobs in both regions, particularly in the technology and research sectors.

At the same time, as AI becomes more pervasive, it is crucial that India and the GCC countries address the associated risks and challenges. According to a survey conducted by a think tank named Oliver Wyman Forum, while the GCC region demonstrates leadership in the adoption of generative AI, with 74 per cent of workers in the UAE and 68 per cent in Saudi Arabia utilising it weekly, there are several challenges that require attention. Notably, 61 per cent of UAE workers and 57 per cent in Saudi Arabia reported that their companies provide inadequate training on the safe and responsible use of AI tools. Furthermore, 92 per cent of UAE workers have inadvertently exposed company data through the use of generative AI applications. Additionally, 82 per cent of UAE workers harbour concerns that the proliferation of AI may ultimately lead to the obsolescence of their current roles.

India, on the other hand, faces its own unique set of challenges in AI development and deployment. These include inadequate infrastructure, lack of public funding, information asymmetries, and the absence of clear regulatory frameworks. Therefore, by pooling resources and knowledge, both regions can speed up the development of new AI applications, enhancing competitiveness in the global market as generative AI technologies can be utilised to innovate faster in product development cycles. Furthermore, AI can enhance cross-border cooperation in critical areas such as cybersecurity, counter-terrorism, and disaster management. Robust AI-powered systems can analyse real-time data, detect threats, and coordinate response mechanisms across borders, strengthening regional security and resilience. Thus, knowledge sharing on AI regulation, data privacy, and cybersecurity best practices can help both regions develop robust AI ecosystems.

However, according to different experts on AI technology, the unregulated deployment of AI technologies also raises ethical questions, particularly concerning bias, accountability, and transparency. Thus, both regions must work together to establish ethical guidelines that govern the use of AI. The potential societal implications of AI, such as job displacement and inequality, need to be addressed collaboratively to ensure that the benefits of AI are distributed equitably across both regions. By collaborating on establishing ethical guidelines for AI development and deployment and ensuring that both regions prioritise transparency, accountability, and fairness in their AI initiatives, India and the GCC can position themselves as responsible global leaders in the AI landscape. In order to address the challenges associated with AI adoption, companies in GCC countries and India should follow these methods: provide clear guidelines and high-quality training to safeguard sensitive data; address worker concerns about AI's impact on employment through transparent communication and retraining initiatives; and implement a robust change management programme to make AI adoption a shared goal among the workforce.

Thus, in conclusion, it would be important to acknowledge that the strategic partnership between India and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries presents a unique opportunity to accelerate the adoption and application of artificial intelligence for mutual benefit. By combining India's technological expertise with the GCC's financial resources and infrastructure, the two regions can drive innovation, address shared challenges, and strengthen regional security and resilience. However, it is crucial that both regions work together to mitigate the risks and ethical concerns associated with AI, ensuring that the development and deployment of these technologies are guided by principles of transparency, accountability, and social responsibility. Thus, through a collaborative approach, India and the GCC can harness the transformative power of AI to enhance cooperation and secure a prosperous and sustainable future for both regions.

17 grudnia 2024 r. prezydent Republiki Uzbekistanu Szawkat Mirzijojew i emir państwa Katar szejk Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani przeprowadzili owocną rozmowę telefoniczną poświęconą pogłębianiu współpracy strategicznej i wdrażaniu porozumień na wysokim szczeblu.
W dyskusji podkreślono rosnące więzi między Uzbekistanem a Katarem, co odzwierciedla znaczny postęp w wielu sektorach:
✅ Rozwój infrastruktury energetycznej i transportowej
✅ Współpraca w turystyce, opiece zdrowotnej i rolnictwie
✅ Projekty inwestycyjne z wiodącymi firmami Kataru
✅ Udane bezpośrednie połączenia lotnicze pobudzające wzajemną turystykę
Do znaczących osiągnięć w tym roku należy inauguracyjne posiedzenie Komisji Międzyrządowej i forum biznesowego w Ad-Dausze, a także udany Tydzień Kultury Kataru w Taszkiencie.
Patrząc w przyszłość do 2025 r., obaj przywódcy podkreślili znaczenie nadchodzących wydarzeń wysokiego szczebla, w tym drugiego szczytu ""Dialogu Azja Środkowa – GCC"".",,https://x.com/Piechocinski/status/1869488427328045552,,,qatar,Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani,twitter,,,,,,0,2,,1,,Janusz Piechociński,Piechocinski,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/873475061700857856/UBow_zRi_normal.jpg,1.0,0.0,2593.0,False,False,False,negative,0.9897275567054749

The Committee stated that the humanitarian aid delivered with the participation of a team from the Qatari International Search and Rescue Group, of the Internal Security Force (Lekhwiya), included food and medical items, along with shelter supplies.
It added that, on Tuesday, an aircraft of the Qatar Armed Forces arrived at Marka military airport in Jordan with nearly 27 tonnes of aid onboard, while last Monday the first aircraft with Qatari aid bound for the Syrians arrived at Gaziantep Airport in the Republic of Turkiye with approximately 28 tonnes of humanitarian aid onboard.
In addition, the Committee undertakes the oversight mission of delivering humanitarian aid and follows up on it, stemming from its role as an entity responsible for the State of Qatar-led rescue and relief operations.
The aid efforts come within the State of Qatar's supportive position for Syria and to consistently stand with the brotherly people of Syria.

🚨BREAKING: DU Students STOPS with City Corporation Workers Who Removing Hasina's HATE Graffiti! 😱

City workers tried to WIPE OUT Sheikh Hasina's satirical graffiti at DU, but students FOUGHT BACK! The art, dubbed a ""hate pillar,"" was a nod to the July Revolution. Despite partial erasure, students STOPPED the operation. 

Now, with new art added, the question burns - Are Hasina's appointed city workers indirectly trying to erase the July memory? 🔥

নগর কর্মীরা ঢাবিতে শেখ হাসিনার ব্যঙ্গাত্মক গ্রাফিতি মুছে ফেলার চেষ্টা করেছিল, কিন্তু ছাত্ররা বাঁধা দিলো! শিল্পটি, একটি ""ঘৃণার স্তম্ভ"" নামে অভিহিত ছিল, এটি ছিল জুলাই বিপ্লবের একটি স্মৃতি। আংশিক মুছে ফেলা সত্ত্বেও, শিক্ষার্থীরা অপারেশন বন্ধ করে দেয়।

এখন, নতুন শিল্প যোগ করায়, প্রশ্ন চলছে- হাসিনার নিয়োগকৃত নগরকর্মীরা কি পরোক্ষভাবে জুলাইয়ের স্মৃতি মুছে ফেলতে চাইছেন? 🔥

Drama Alert! 🇧🇩🇮🇳 Yunus Demands Delhi Return Hasina, But Modi Plays Cool! 🧊

Bangladesh's new leader, Mohammad Yunus, has penned a fiery letter to Delhi, urging the return of ex-PM Sheikh Hasina. But whispers from Modi's office suggest they're not in a rush to comply. 

What's the real story behind this diplomatic tug-of-war? 🤔 

নাটক! 🇧🇩🇮🇳 ইউনূস দিল্লীতে হাসিনাকে ফেরানোর দাবি, কিন্তু মোদি নিশ্চুপ! 🧊

বাংলাদেশের নতুন নেতা মোহাম্মদ ইউনূস সাবেক প্রধানমন্ত্রী শেখ হাসিনাকে ফেরানোর আহ্বান জানিয়ে দিল্লিতে একটি জ্বলন্ত চিঠি লিখেছেন। কিন্তু মোদির অফিস থেকে বলছে তারা কোন তাড়াহুড়ো দেখছে না।

এই কূটনৈতিক টানাপোড়েনের পেছনের আসল কাহিনী কী? 🤔

🚨 SHOCKING REVELATIONS! RAB's Brutality Under Sheikh Hasina's Govt - Enforced Disappearances, Bodies Found on Rails and Rivers! 🔍

Victims Tortured Without Anesthesia, Lips Stitched, Electric Shocks Administered! 

How can a human do such horrible torture to another human? 🥺

Sin embargo, bajo esta imagen pulida se esconde una serie de polémicas relacionadas con una supuesta evasión fiscal y asociaciones con terroristas.

👁️👁️No te pierdas este post, vía @visegrad24 :

Sheikha Moza ha utilizado Al Jazeera como herramienta para proteger la imagen de Qatar y promover su visión del país como un Estado moderno y progresista, desviando al mismo tiempo las críticas. Así es como funciona: 
Crítica selectiva: Bajo la influencia de Sheikha Moza, Al Jazeera se centra en denunciar la corrupción y los abusos en Estados rivales como Arabia Saudí y Egipto, pero evita informar sobre las propias violaciones de los derechos humanos en Qatar. Narrativa controlada: Al Jazeera opera como una entidad controlada por el Estado, lo que garantiza que no se emitan críticas al régimen de Qatar, incluidas las políticas e iniciativas de Sheikha Moza. Expansión del poder blando: A través de plataformas como Al Jazeera English, Sheikha Moza posiciona a Qatar como un líder mundial con visión de futuro, enmascarando los problemas internos al tiempo que se alinea con los objetivos geopolíticos de Qatar. Polémicas: Al Jazeera ha sido acusada de promover grupos islamistas como los Hermanos Musulmanes y de utilizar información sesgada para desestabilizar a los rivales de Qatar.

La imagen humanitaria de Sheikha Moza frente a la casa familiar más extravagante de Londres 
En 2013, la familia de Sheikha Moza adquirió dos de las propiedades más caras de Londres, 1 y 2-3 Cornwall Terrace, por la asombrosa cifra de 120 millones de libras. Estos edificios catalogados de Grado I, que datan de la década de 1820, se encuentran entre las viviendas más caras del mundo. 1 Cornwall Terrace: 7 dormitorios, 11 salones, 9 cuartos de baño, gimnasio privado y un garaje de última generación con reconocimiento de matrícula para dos limusinas. 2-3 Cornwall Terrace: Convertida en una única residencia de 6 dormitorios. Se hicieron planes para fusionar las propiedades en una supermansión de 17 dormitorios, incluyendo 14 salones, un cine, un bar de zumos y una piscina. Aunque el permiso de obras inicial fue denegado en 2015 debido a la escasez de viviendas, en 2020 se aprobó una solicitud revisada. ¿Cómo se alinea semejante opulencia con su defensa de la igualdad global y su apoyo a las comunidades marginadas?

Los Pandora Papers y la evasión fiscal 
Los Pandora Papers revelaron que Qatar, y en este caso la familia de Sheika Moza, utilizaba entidades extraterritoriales para eludir impuestos. 
- Las adquisiciones de la familia eludieron a las autoridades fiscales británicas, privándolas de ingresos millonarios. 
- La explotación sistemática de los vacíos legales por parte de Qatar les permitió eludir 18,5 millones de libras esterlinas en impuestos.
Financiación de grupos extremistas 
Bajo el mandato de Sheikha Moza, Qatar ha sido acusado de financiar grupos extremistas: 
- Qatar acoge a dirigentes de Hamás, y Sheikha Moza elogia a figuras como Yahya Sinwar. Hasta el 2 de diciembre, Qatar acogía a muchos dirigentes de Hamás que huían de Palestina tras su ataque terrorista contra Israel. 
- Doha facilitó la oficina política de los talibanes. - Al parecer, las filiales de Al Qaeda se beneficiaron indirectamente de los fondos qataríes.
Explotación de los trabajadores inmigrantes similar a la esclavitud
Mientras Sheikha Moza aboga por el progreso mundial, el sistema laboral de Qatar sigue explotando a sus más de 2 millones de trabajadores inmigrantes: 
- Los salarios impagados y las comisiones de contratación engañosas están muy extendidas, a pesar de reformas como el Fondo de Apoyo a los Trabajadores, que solo indemnizó a 36.000 trabajadores en 2022. 
- Miles de muertes inexplicadas de trabajadores fueron descartadas como «causas naturales», dejando a las familias sin compensación. 
- El sistema de kafala sigue criminalizando a los trabajadores que abandonan a sus empleadores sin permiso, y persisten la confiscación de pasaportes y las duras condiciones.
 - Las protecciones contra el estrés térmico introducidas en 2021 no logran evitar los entornos de trabajo peligrosos. 
- A pesar de las reformas laborales, la explotación de los trabajadores por parte de Qatar para proyectos como la Copa Mundial refleja un abuso sistémico continuo.

Hipocresía de los derechos de género 
Mientras la jequesa Moza promueve la igualdad de género en el extranjero, las mujeres qataríes se enfrentan a graves restricciones: Las leyes de tutela masculina limitan los derechos de las mujeres a viajar, casarse, trabajar y acceder a la educación superior sin permiso masculino. Las solteras menores de 25 años necesitan permiso para viajar al extranjero, y los tribunales pueden prohibirles viajar si los familiares varones se oponen. Denunciar la violencia sexual conlleva el riesgo de ser procesada por «relaciones sexuales fuera del matrimonio», castigado con hasta 7 años de prisión. Las mujeres son ingresadas involuntariamente en pabellones psiquiátricos y manicomios si quieren separarse de sus maridos maltratadores. Las mujeres qataríes también tienen prohibida la tutela legal de sus hijos y no están protegidas contra la violencia doméstica.

Supresión de la disidencia 
Bajo la influencia de Sheikha Moza, Qatar reprime duramente la disidencia: 
- La vigilancia en Internet sigue la pista de los críticos con el régimen. - Las leyes de censura castigan las críticas al emir, la religión o las «noticias falsas» con hasta 5 años de cárcel o fuertes multas. 
- La ley de ciberdelitos de 2014 penaliza los contenidos en línea que «atenten contra los valores sociales», silenciando la disidencia. Ejemplo: El poeta Mohammed al-Ajami fue condenado a cadena perpetua (posteriormente reducida a 15 años) en 2012 por un poema considerado insultante para el emir, lo que pone de manifiesto la intolerancia catarí ante las críticas.

Defensa de la educación con límites 
Sheikha Moza defiende la educación en todo el mundo, ha desempeñado un papel decisivo en la creación de instituciones educativas, pero el motivo de su pasión está claro: el adoctrinamiento. 
- Al Jazeera Children's Channel y Education City, que promueven narrativas favorables al régimen y limitan la libertad académica. - Su defensa oculta tendencias autoritarias más profundas.

La polémica dimisión de Sheikha Moza de la UNESCO
En noviembre de 2023, dimitió dramáticamente como embajadora de buena voluntad de la UNESCO después de dos décadas, alegando el «fracaso» de la organización a la hora de abordar la crisis de Gaza. Acusó a la UNESCO de permanecer en silencio ante los ataques contra escuelas y estudiantes, especialmente en Gaza. Los críticos sostienen que su dimisión no se debió tanto a preocupaciones humanitarias como a la intención de ocultar el controvertido historial de Qatar. Qatar, bajo su influencia, ha sido acusado de silenciar la disidencia, explotar a los trabajadores migrantes y financiar a grupos extremistas. A pesar de su defensa de Gaza, el apoyo de Qatar a Hamás plantea dudas sobre sus verdaderas intenciones, ya que Hamás utiliza a civiles palestinos como escudos humanos para lograr sus objetivos políticos.

Los derechos LGBT, atacados 
En Qatar, las personas LGBT sufren discriminación y abusos sistemáticos: Las Fuerzas de Seguridad Preventivas detienen arbitrariamente a personas por su expresión de género, realizan registros telefónicos ilegales y someten a los detenidos a palizas y acoso sexual. Las leyes penalizan las relaciones entre personas del mismo sexo, con penas de hasta 7 años de prisión. Las violaciones de derechos humanos en Qatar siguen estando profundamente arraigadas.

Legado de contradicciones 
La jequesa Moza simboliza el progreso y la modernidad para unos, y la hipocresía y los privilegios para otros. Su historia es una historia de poder, influencia y gestión estratégica de la imagen, que deja que el mundo decida si es una verdadera reformista o una cara bonita pulida para las verdades más oscuras de Qatar. Una cosa es cierta. Como cofundadora y Presidenta de la Qatar Foundation, la mayor organización sin ánimo de lucro del país, desempeña un papel importante en la forma en que el país utiliza su enorme riqueza de gas para influir en otros países de la región y de Occidente. Ha desempeñado un papel fundamental en la apertura de universidades estadounidenses en la ciudad educativa de Doha. Apodada «La mujer detrás de la Ciudad de la Educación de Doha» como parte de la estrategia de poder blando de Qatar en las universidades occidentales, sus estrategias en este ámbito han repercutido en decenas de miles de estudiantes universitarios estadounidenses sin que ellos sepan siquiera quién es.

La conexión con Hamás 
En enero de 2024 se lanzó una campaña mediática mundial con los lemas «Está en tus manos» y «Tú tienes el poder». La campaña pedía a la jequesa Moza que aprovechara su autoridad para garantizar la liberación de 136 rehenes retenidos por Hamás en Gaza, entre los que había mujeres, niños y ancianos, entre ellos ciudadanos estadounidenses. Sheikha Moza hizo caso omiso y siguió escribiendo en Internet mensajes contra Israel. Tras la masacre del 7 de octubre, Sheikha Moza publicó una foto en su cuenta de Instagram de un hombre con las manos en la cabeza frente a un edificio derruido, acompañada del pie de foto: «Oh Alá, te confiamos Palestina».

Under Sheikha Moza’s influence, Qatar harshly suppresses dissent:

• Internet surveillance tracks regime critics.

• Censorship laws punish criticism of the Emir, religion, or “false news” with up to 5 years in prison or heavy fines.

• The 2014 cybercrimes law criminalizes online content that “violates social values,” silencing dissent.

Military analyst, terrorist Ron Ben-Yishai in Haaretz:

- ""israel""s targeting of Iran will not change anything in Yemen

- The war of attrition they are waging against ""israel"" in support of the Palestinian cause is gaining them support inside Yemen and the Arab world

- The Houthis are very satisfied with the international status they have gained after showing that they are the party that decides whether there is maritime trade in the Red Sea and from there to the Suez Canal or not

- The Houthis, after their ability to disrupt global trade, are trying to change the world order

- The geographical distance and intelligence obstacles make this task difficult for Israel alone.",,https://x.com/IRIran_Military/status/1871921338971287987,,,qatar,Qatar Emir,twitter,,,,,,701,3325,Islamic Republic of Iran,195,,Iran Military,IRIran_Military,https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1799809408865587200/PFUEs0sq_normal.jpg,195.0,19.0,89263.0,False,False,False,positive,0.616628885269165

He doesn't even know if any of those claims are true or no. For example the right to property was only reserved for the Uma and not the people they conquered. A few hundred Arabs owned everything and everyone in an entire kingdom their soldiers of Allah had conquered for them, meanwhile civilizations thousands of years older than Islam protected  property rights in a more civilized way than the Muslims did. And if he's talking about the later caliphates system of laws, they didn't come from Sharia, they came from the advanced civilizations they had conquered. They use the laws of land not Sharia when it came to managing vast Empire that was in many ways copycat of the Persian and Roman Empire that preceded them in the lands they administered, simply because they knew they had such a limited manpower and had to use decentralized administrative systems that advanced civilizations prior to them had developed.

According to Reuters, Qatar's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mohammed Al-Khulaifi flew into Damascus and met with Syria's de facto new ruler Ahmed al-Sharaa on Monday. The meeting focused on investment in the energy sector and ports, with Qatari officials expressing their willingness to support Syria during this crucial period.  Al-Sharaa also received a visit from Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman al-Safadi, marking the first Arab foreign minister to visit Damascus since Assad's ouster two weeks ago. 

The meeting signifies a widening diplomatic network for the new Syrian administration established by the HTS, a former Al Qaeda affiliate which overthrew President Bashar al-Assad. The end of Assad's rule upended Middle Eastern geopolitics and opened opportunities for other nations to engage with Syria.  Turkey was first to send its Foreign Minister to Damascus and Qatar is set to invest heavily in the country's energy sector and ports. 

The visit also focused on counteracting drug smuggling from Syria to Jordan, a concern for Jordan which shares a border with the country. Safadi underscored cooperation against Islamic State as well, highlighting the threat of the group despite Al-Sharaa's focus on reconstruction.  Jordan is prepared to provide aid in this rebuilding process and will cooperate in combating the resurgence of ISIS.

Mansour then explains that pragmatism does not mean opportunism but realism (maybe he's thinking of Qatar's model?).
Any how, Sharaa himself said that he was young and immature when he joined Al-Qaeda, and that he has since changed.
Is Sharaa pretending to have changed? Is he still an Islamist like Qatar and Mansour are trying to convince us? I'd say, let's judge Sharaa based on his deeds, going forward, not on his past (which Mansour recounts in detail). 
I remain cautiously optimistic that Syria is moving in a better direction, not the best direction toward a Jeffersonian democracy, but in a direction better than it was under Assad and Hezbollah, and better than it would have been under an Islamist who could have declared himself, on day one, an Islamist whose mission was to ""liberate Palestine"" and defeat imperialism (Khomeini).
