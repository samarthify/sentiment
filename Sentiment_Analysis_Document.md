    python -m src.agent.core
    ```
    *(Ensure you are in the project root directory with the virtual environment activated)*

2.  **Start the API Service** (in a separate terminal):
    ```bash
    python -m src.api.service
    ```
    *(Ensure you are in the project root directory with the virtual environment activated)*

3.  **Start the Dashboard** (in a separate terminal):
    ```bash
    cd dashboard
    npm start
    ```
    The dashboard should open in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Configuration Options (`config/default_config.json`)

Example structure:
```json
{
    "collection_interval_minutes": 30,
    "processing_interval_minutes": 60,
    "data_retention_days": 30,
    "monitoring": { ... },
    "sources": {
        "x": true,
        "news": true,
        "instagram": true, // Adjust based on available collectors
        "linkedin": true,  // Adjust based on available collectors
        "mention": true, // Adjust based on available collectors
        "social_searcher": true // Adjust based on available collectors
    }
}
```

### Key Environment Variables (`config/.env`)

*   API credentials for data sources (X, News APIs, etc.)
*   Database connection details (if applicable)
*   SMTP configuration for email notifications (Provider, Server, Port, User, Pass)
*   LLM API keys and settings (if applicable)

### Troubleshooting

*   Check logs in the `logs/` directory.
*   Verify API keys and credentials in `config/.env`.
*   Ensure all dependencies (`requirements.txt`, `dashboard/package.json`) are installed correctly in the activated environments.
*   Confirm Python and Node.js versions meet prerequisites.
*   Check network connectivity for external API access.

### Updating the System

1.  Stop all running services (Agent, API, Dashboard).
2.  Pull the latest changes: `git pull`
3.  Update dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    cd dashboard && npm install
    cd ..
    ```
4.  Review any changes in `config/.env.example` and update your `config/.env` if necessary.
5.  Restart all services.
